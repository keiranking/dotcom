# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Squared app (hereby referred to as "app") for mobile devices that was created by Keiran King (hereby referred to as "service provider", "us" or "we") as a freemium service. This service is intended for use "as is".

## What information does the app obtain and how is it used?

The app does not obtain any personally identifiable information when you download and use it. Registration is not required to use the app.

## Does the app collect precise real time location information of the device?

This app does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.

## Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the app?

Since the app does not collect any information, no data is shared with third parties.

## What are my opt-out rights?

You can stop all collection of information by the app easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

## Children

The app is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. We encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the app and/or Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the app and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to us through the app, contact us so we can take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Security

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However, since the app does not collect any information, there is minimal risk of your data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-11-01.

## Your Consent

By using the app, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the service provider.
