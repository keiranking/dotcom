Jamaica is a country of contrasts, carved out by its history as a former
slave plantation and British colony. It is mere divine co-incidence that in
this Jamaica50 year celebrating the start of the 'new Jamaica', two plays
currently running in Kingston demonstrate very accurately, the development of
the nation from the start of the struggle for freedom, to the Jamaica of today,
showing the difference between uptown and downtown, rich and poor, two studies
in Black and Blacke.

Mr & Mrs Blacke is set in the uptown St Andrew world of gated communities and
three-bedroom townhouses with designer d√©cor, where a stay-at-home wife and her
investment broker husband battle verbally to define their marriage and secure
their financial goals.

Mr and Mrs Blacke are obsessed with wealth. Mr Blacke is anxious to seal a
deal with a former boss that will earn him millions, but Mrs Blacke is jealous
of the former boss - a woman, and suspects the deal and the relationship. As
the viability of the deal is questioned, the foundation of the childless
relationship frays and the quarrel that has been simmering under their
10-year-old marriage erupts into a fight that opens old wounds. Mr Blacke
throws Mrs Blacke out of the house, she returns defiantly and then - no, I
won't spoil the ending.

Stanley, Fay, Pularchie & P takes place nearly a century ago in a downtown
Kingston tenement yard, at a time when poor Jamaican workers were beginning to
protest slave wages in a series of island-wide strikes and riots that gave
birth to the modern trade-union movement.

The play was written by the late Gloria Lannaman with a central theme of the
labour unrest of the 1930s. The playwright uses this period of Jamaica's
history to weave a tale of the life and human condition of the black working
class of that time, and the significant political and social developments that
led to the Jamaica of today.

Stanley, a wharf worker who lives with and loves Fay, is agitating the other
workers to demand a raise in their wages from nine pence to one shilling an
hour - a surprisingly princely sum to Joey, the country-bumpkin-come-to-town
who earns nine pence a day as a farm manager!

Stanley's efforts to persuade the workers to join his demands for more pay are
resisted by Silas, who says workers cannot win against management when there
is so much willing, free labour. Stanley's efforts to mobilise the workers
causes him to lose his job, then as rioting begins in the street, Silas is
killed and Stanley is framed for his murder. To escape, he must- no I won't
spoil the ending either.


Seeing these two plays one night after the other was an unusual experience of
social contrasts for me. In two nights of good theatre, Jamaica takes an
astonishing leap from yesterday to today. You get the feeling that if the
characters in either play met each other in real life, neither would recognise
nor acknowledge the reality of the other.

No one in 1938 could have believed that their grandchildren could have left the
ghetto so spectacularly as the two uptowners in their pristine white townhouse.
Nor could the two uptowners accustomed to their smartphones, gym appointments
and expensive lunch dates - ever believe they came from the humble beginnings
of Stanley and Fay's yard, though in fact, we all came from there in one way
or other.

Compared with the pathos and emotion of Stanley and Fay, Mr and Mrs Blacke's
marital strife seems trivial and even amusing. But it is as real a picture of
the economic lives that fashion Jamaica today. This is no less true of Stanley
and Fay in yesterday's Jamaica.

In fact, it is so uncanny how similar both couples are, that both plays should
be a compulsory double-bill presentation for all Jamaica to see.


What both plays have in common are some stellar performances, rarely seen on a
Jamaican stage. Mr & Mrs Blacke has only two actors, Keiran King, the first, is
not just a good actor, believable in the role, but he also wrote the play and
produced it. He and Keisha Patterson - a perfect portrayal of female yuppie
hysteria occupy the stage throughout the entire play in a perfectly coordinated
dialogue that ranges through all emotions that expose the highs and lows of
their relationship with keen acting talent.

The story of the yuppie couple gives a telling (and perhaps accurate) glimpse
of the life, interests and aspirations of those behind the gated walls of
'uptown' and the play is a tour-de-force of acting, as well as a well-written
story not often seen in Jamaican theatre.

The surprising ending adds up, but it's a story we hope isn't fully over,
perhaps a sequel - as it was such a pleasure.

Director Paul Issa moves his actors effortlessly across the stage, giving them
dramatic action and pacing that makes the play a delight to enjoy. He says he
worked hard to present the characters truthfully, without passing judgement on
their flawed but human natures. The producers, Eight Seven Six, whose brochure
states that they 'set their standards high', presented an exceptionally
beautiful set that gave an accurate setting for the drama, including an outdoor
garden with plants on which 'rain' falls very realistically in one part of the
play.

Set design is again a beautiful feature of the Stanley and Faye set, this time
the brick and board, zinc roofs of a downtown yard are spread across the stage.
At one side the walls of one house disappear in a scene change to reveal a
bedroom in another part of town, while in another scene a very realistic
'country truck' bumps and jolts the comic relief couple, Joey and Doris,
towards the country. The audience was in awe of the set changes which were
quick and quiet.

The players are each excellent. Dennis Titus as Stanley shines in his role as
the labour leader, with Sherando Ferril as his girlfriend Fay. Maurice Bryan
plays Stanley's friend Nathan who joins him, while veteran actor Carl Davis
plays Silas who does not support the cause. Marguerite Newland plays Miss
Pularchie, matron of the yard and mother of Doris, and actually played the
role of Doris in the original staging of the play in 1974. Special mention
must be made of Donald 'Iceman' Anderson who played 'Joey' with a unique
comedic talent that made his scenes memorable.

Director Pablo Hoilet can be proud of his work. This was a class production.

Stanley and Fay was a great reminder of days gone by. The language so carefully
researched by writer Lannaman, caused us to laugh to hear it. Remember
'chuppence' (Threepence) or 'grip' (small suitcase)'? 'Whe' yu ben dey?'
(Where were you?) caused the loudest laugh of the night.

But more than the laughs, was the opportunity to be reminded of what our
forefathers endured to win full freedoms from slavery, through the struggle of
the 1938 workers.

It's a battle worth remembering, as we celebrate 50 years of an Independent
Jamaica. Congrats to producers Marjorie Whylie and Pauline Stone-Myrie, who
played Fay and Ms Pularchie in the original production.


Overall, these two plays show that Jamaican theatre still has moments of
excellence, amidst the popular camaraderie that graces our stages. I encourage
productions to have a film record made of these theatrical gems, so that
generations to come may have the opportunity shared by a few adventurous
theatre-goers who value live, high quality entertainment.

Mr & Mrs Blacke is being played at the Philip Sherlock Centre, University of
the West Indies, while Stanley Faye, Pularchie & P is being held at Theatre
Place, Haining Road.
