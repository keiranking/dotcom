“There’s a storm coming,” Samantha Blacke warns her just-home-from-work
husband Nicholas in the opening scene of Mr & Mrs Blacke, a potent but flawed
two-hander marital drama from writer-producer Keiran King. But Samantha’s
words are as much an admonition for her husband as they are for the audience,
which is in for a deeply emotional trip across the unpredictable terrain of
love and matrimony, as we eavesdrop on this young, well-to-do couple over the
course of an evening inside the luxurious living room of their luxurious upper
St. Andrew home.

It’s a visually charming production to be sure; the set is lovely to look at
and the overall setting is beautifully lit. But if Desperate Housewives has
taught me anything it’s that the appearance of wholesome attractiveness is
never to be trusted. As it happens, beneath the gorgeous façade lurks ugly
and deep-seated emotions (rage, despair, disillusionment) that are just dying
to come out. In other words, all is not black and white.

Meticulous and mistrusting, Samantha (Patterson) is a Shakespeare-spouting
aspiring writer with, um, issues. The hubby (King), on the other hand, is a
successful investment banker who comes off as a burdened fellow given to
regular bouts of cynicism. They hardly seem the perfect match. But given their
good fortune, you can’t help but wonder what the hell are they so miserable
about? Well, as that wise man famously said, you never know the value of what
you’ve got till you lose it.

That’s a fact the Blackes must come to terms with the hard way. What starts
out as a quiet, relaxing evening soon deteriorates into a tempest of screaming
and shouting and things better left unsaid. “You’re driving me crazy,” bites
Nicholas at one point. “The feeling is mutual,” Samantha snaps back without
missing a beat.

In just a few short years, King has become known for favouring dialogue-heavy
scripts, and Blacke is no exception with some truly witty lines and wise
observations. But the play does sag around the middle, growing into a tedious
longeur until the pace finally quickens and the temperature in the room takes
a heated turn.

As for the performances, King and Patterson are no great thespians, but they
are adequately competent actors, and with Issa extending a steady hand over
the proceedings, the turns are regularly nuanced and revealing.

“Nobody wants to watch people fall out of love,” remarks one of the characters.
And, truly, there is perhaps no line that better speaks to Mr & Mrs Blacke.
Though a solid work with its bright moments, as a study of complicated lovers
and trust and misunderstanding it sometimes shows its stitching and
occasionally loses its way.
