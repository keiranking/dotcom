In Keiran King's latest production, Taboo, there were no interruptions from the
customary blackout of lights to indicate the end of a scene. The smooth
transitions had much to do with the very functional set and the brilliant
directing of Eugene Williams.

Taboo tells the story of two flawed couples Sabrina (Lisa Williams) and William
(King); and Gina (Yendi Phillipps) and John (Rodney Campbell). They have come
together for another family dinner. On this occasion, the dinner is special as
it is William's (an author) 30th birthday.

Immediately, there are the underpinnings of trouble, as the opening
conversation between William and Sabrina didn't suggest a happy 30th.

As the story progresses, the four find themselves grappling with angst of
varied degrees.

The strong ending of the play was just one of the director's moments of
thoughtfulness and creativity. Throughout the production, there were constant
reminders of this.

The use of levels was quite effective when the four characters are seated at
the dining table. Another plus for Eugene is the use of toys to reinforce the
underlying theme of immaturity.

The play, written by King, seems to have plunged into the theatre of the
absurd, not the easiest choice for a playwright.

One of the more difficult skills is to bring the one-dimensional characters
often present in the genre to life.

Commendations most go to King, Williams, Phillipps and Campbell for making
what could have been flat characters memorable.

Campbell, who was the most articulate of the four, made the rather laid-back
John appealing. He was also humorous in the delivery of his lines and was
rather entertaining in the fight scene.

Philipps, in her d√©but role as Gina, William's sister, and mother of two
children was real.

The chemistry required for the relationship between her character and that of
King's was convincing.

No one knows the character William better than King, after all he created him.

This was demonstrated when the multitalented thespian captured the irrational
behaviour of a trapped, dissatisfied and possessive man, producing humour,
alarm and disgust.

Williams did well. The distraught, self-centred, very talkative (especially
after a few drinks) medical sales representative Sabrina was well played. She,
along with Phillipps, however, may want to be consistent with projection of
their voices, as there were moments where lines were lost, especially when the
audience became vociferous.

Bringing together the creative elements of the thought-provoking production was
the set designed by King.

While it was not on the grand scale of his previous productions, the spectacle
remained the same, as the designer used bright, contrasting colours to good
effect.

The theme of childhood was also captured in recognisable mathematical shapes
woven into the building and the furniture.

In general, Taboo is a creatively presented production and is well worth
seeing. It is for adults only and is currently staged at the Sir Philip
Sherlock Centre, University of the West Indies, Mona, from Tuesday to Sunday.

On Tuesdays the show offers a two-for-one at 8 p.m. It continues Wednesday
through Saturday at 8 and on Sunday at 6 p.m.
