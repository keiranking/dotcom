The popular saying “finders keepers, losers weepers” might very well be Giddy
Holness’ favourite. It’s an axiom she takes entirely to heart and insists on
applying to all facets of her life. Please pay keen attention to her name.

A chirpy middle-aged woman (an assistant zoo keeper) hampered by loneliness and
fantasies of a romantic dreamboat one day sweeping her off her feet, Giddy
(Terri Salmon) can hardly believe her good fortune when she stumbles upon a
handsome (and scantily clad!) man lying unconscious on the streets of New
Kingston on a particularly active public holiday; an annual marathon is
underway and 'John Doe' (who Giddy later christens as her Italian stud,
Antonio) is suspected to have been a participant whose stamina failed him. With
the help of an unwitting cop, she takes the unconscious man, her unexpected
prize, back to the apartment she shares with her good girlfriend Charlene
(Keneisha Bowes), who is understandably dumbfounded by her friend’s actions.

Is Giddy simply a desperate and love-sick soul or a seriously unhinged loony in
need of psychiatric attention? (Or both?) Those questions and many others lurk
at the centre of I Take This Man, director Pablo Hoilett’s amusing and
well-acted adaptation of Jack Sharkey’s admirable two-act comedy. The first few
minutes of the Hoilett production are particularly grating and hinder the show
from taking off early. Before long, however, as the actors begin to settle into
their roles, the whole thing evolves into wonderfully clever, hilarious
entertainment with a handful of delightful surprises in store.

A competent comedic actress, Salmon’s trademark vivacity threatens to eclipse
the production, especially in scenes that demand high energy and rapid-fire
dialogue as a plan is frantically hatched to make Antonio fall in love with
Giddy. Salmon shines most, though, when required to dial back the bubbly
personality and display some degree of susceptibility. As for the rest of the
cast, great support comes from talented newbie Bowes and a superb Clive Duncan,
who gives a very natural and controlled performance as Charlene’s agitated
fiancé, who is reluctantly caught up in the madness.

But the most impressive turn comes from the gangly Keiran King, who
courageously spends the greater part of the show as the central male figure,
Antonio, the mystery man, with his privates prominently displayed in a pair of
flattering red mantights. If King’s performance is to be believed, he is a man
entirely at ease with his lanky physique.

Far-fetched as its premise might seem, I Take This Man is a completely
plausible tale, spun with humour, dramatic irony and a touch of serendipity.
The lighting is frequently gorgeous and Giddy’s tastefully embellished
apartment makes for appealing set décor. Fresh, buoyant and unreservedly
enjoyable, I Take This Man is a funny little surprise.
