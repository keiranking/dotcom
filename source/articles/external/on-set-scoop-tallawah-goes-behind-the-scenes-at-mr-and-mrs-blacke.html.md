Surely there can’t be anywhere more unglamorous than this nondescript warehouse
towards the back of the Sagicor Industrial Complex, off South Camp Road in
Kingston. That is until you set foot inside the building on a balmy Thursday
evening and realize that its occupants are busy making fabulous art. Welcome
to the rehearsal and set-construction space of Eight Seven Six, the theatre
production outfit that put on last year’s award-winning musical opus, Last Call.

These days, building on the incredible momentum from last season, the company’s
principals and technical team, are gearing up to astonish local theatergoers
anew with Mr. & Mrs. Blacke, a dialogue-heavy marriage drama, which is a month
away from opening at Mona’s Philip Sherlock Centre.

As TALLAWAH soon discovers, putting on a show with a difference is the Eight
Seven Six way. And, taking a page from the Broadway manual on how to succeed
in show business, it all starts with securing a proper and dedicated working
space that, in its own way, is conducive to the creation of theatrical magic.
“The idea is that from the ground up, we approach putting on a show very
differently. We try and approach it in a very professional and very
comprehensive and First-World way,” explains the show’s writer (and male lead)
Keiran King. “So we get a dedicated space. We recreate the theatre inside that
space and we build everything, as I said, from the ground up.”

A quick glance around the expansive room reveals aspects of the set under
construction, as well as work tables, desks, a few chairs and props that will
find their way into the final product come July. “We’ve been here at Sagicor
since the middle of May and will be here until four or five days before
opening [night]. We’ll just move everything wholesale like the week before,”
says King. “And the idea is that the construction crew can come and see
exactly what they need to do because everything is here to scale. Things are
marked out on the floor. The set designers can build unimpeded by any
distractions. So they work in the day. We come in and rehearse at night.”

And rehearse they do. Just ask Keisha Patterson, the leading lady, who along
with King makes up the cast. “These rehearsals have me on an emotional
rollercoaster. It’s really in-depth,” she admits, curled kitten-like on a sofa.
“This character has a lot of layers to her, and we’re into everyday rehearsals.
So it takes a lot out of you.”

But she’s not complaining. Being a natural performer from day one, Patterson is
used to the hard work that comes with the territory. “I grew up in the theatre;
I started as a pre-teen in theatre, so this is really my life. I’m used to
this,” she explains, adding that her attention to detail has also come in
handy. “I’m definitely a perfectionist. I sleep with my script. I wake up with
it. I need to get the emotion right. It has to be true, and once that happens
then the character is really living. And the director, Paul Issa, really gets
in-depth, so it’s awesome.”

For Issa, helming the project was simply an opportunity too good to pass up –
especially in the wake of Last Call’s tremendous success, including an Actor
Boy win for Best Production. “I’m very glad that they asked me to direct it.
I was quite impressed with many aspects of Keiran’s last production, and he
told me he’s written this play and he sent it to me and asked if I’d direct
it, and I said yes,” explains Issa (Tartuffe).

“It’s a very well-written play, I think. It’s a very unusual work,” the
director continues. “It deals with a different kind of socio-economic bracket
from what most Jamaican plays deal with. But I like the way it was written,
and I like the professionalism of the crew, how they go about doing everything.
And I am delighted to be working with such a talented cast. It’s just great."
