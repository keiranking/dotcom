Navigating this life, trying to find one’s way, trying to decipher who one is
supposed to be when one has ‘grown up’ but is yet a child in an adult’s body is
what Keiran King’s, “Taboo”, is all about. From set design to character traits,
there is a motif of childishness and immaturity that pervades the production.

The brightly coloured set of primary colours red, yellow and blue which take
the shapes of a square, triangle and circle which blocks sections of the house
is evocative of a kindergarten classroom which aids in the suggestion of
youthful meanderings.

The much publicized play that you shouldn’t see, delves into the marital and
personal struggles of two couples…four people, Sabrena (Lisa Williams) and
William (Keiran King) and Gina (Yendi Phillips) and John (Rodney Campbell), who
seem successful enough, but who are dissatisfied on many levels with the lives
they’re leading.

Their struggles are reminiscent of many of ours, well, let me not say that as
I don’t know about you, but I certainly do find myself with much of the angst
that faces King’s character, William.

“What am I doing with my life?” Having that feeling in the pit of my stomach
that reminds me that time is running out and I have yet to accomplish any great
feats. Feeling that at my age I should be doing something more significant with
my life — despairing that I perhaps never will.

William’s struggles are inherently mirror images of mine, so I no doubt would
identify strongly with him as a character, but it takes a talented actor to
reach inside himself and find the torment and agony that is the daily life of
such a soul and bring it to life so palpably on stage. Poetic, dramatic,
melancholy — the torture and anguish of an artist is perfectly captured.

Sabrena’s is another character that was well played. Behind the loud, crass,
drunkeness that is her chosen facade, I could see in her eyes, hear in her
voice that the vulgar extremities to which she often deferred was a mere cover,
cloaking the dark place of pain from which her dissatisfaction arises. My only
dissatisfaction comes from not knowing her backstory.

Where I do find acting skills lacking though, is in the character of Gina,
played by theatre new comer, Yendi Phillips. I find her expressions could have
been stronger, her lines delivered with more conviction, that she could have
been a bit more immersed in her role, but, it was a fair attempt I believe, for
a debut.

On the whole, however, the chemistry among these players was undeniable. The
obvious dysfunction of William’s and Sabrena’s marriage was exciting to watch;
their heated and witty exchanges made for much laughter but they indeed did
still have a spark that set off fireworks, and not necessarily the good kind,
every few minutes. The slow unravelling of Gina’s and John’s ‘perfect union’
which culminated at the shocking revelation of the unspeakable relationship,
from which the play gets its name, was another story altogether; the moral of
which is, ‘Not all that glisters is gold‘.

The world is filled with so many taboos, many of which are much less so now
than in decades past, but none have dared touch this particular taboo which is
the central conflict of this production; but Keiran King has opened the door
and left it slightly ajar so theatre goers may return to think on it long after
they’ve left the theatre.

Pandora’s box has been opened.
