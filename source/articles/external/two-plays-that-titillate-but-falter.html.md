Could a Jamaican win the Nobel Prize for Literature? Could two? Specifically,
could talented playwrights David Tulloch and Keiran King, who are also fine
actors and successful theatre producers?

On the face of it, there shouldn't be any insurmountable obstacle to their
winning the prize. After all, three Caribbean writers from smaller islands than
ours - and so a smaller pool of talent - have done so. They are Alexis
Saint-Léger Léger (writing as Saint-John Perse) of Guadeloupe, in 1960; Derek
Walcott of St Lucia, in 1992; and V.S. Naipaul of Trinidad and Tobago, in 2001.

Tulloch and King have already won local Actor Boy Awards for their productions
and, if they always try to write their best, they'll continue to improve. And
continuous improvement is the path to Stockholm, where the Literature Nobel
(along with most of the others) is handed out.

But here's the thing - with their current plays, Risqué (Tulloch's, at Stages
Theatreplex) and Taboo (King's, at the Philip Sherlock Centre for the Creative
Arts, Mona), they have slipped off the path.

German writer and artist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe gives us a handy tool for
critiquing artistic creations. You ask three questions: "What is the artist
trying to do? How well has he/she done it? Is it worth doing?"

Taking the last question first, since audiences have been finding the plays
entertaining, I'll say for at least that reason they were worth doing. But on
the first question, the two playwrights fail the 'path-to-Stockholm' test. The
titles and, more important, the contents of the plays indicate...
