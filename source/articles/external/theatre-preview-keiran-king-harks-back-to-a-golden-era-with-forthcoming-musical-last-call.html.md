“The type of theatre I am interested in is of a quality that you can probably
see off-Broadway and which, I believe, can be Jamaicanized,” notes Keiran King
ahead of this summer’s Last Call, his debut writing-directorial project, which
happens to be a romantic musical drama set at the dawn of the 1950s at
Kingston’s once-flourishing Myrtle Bank Hotel. It’s no doubt an ambitious but
undeniably buzzy undertaking for the budding playwright and director, fresh off
a surprising Best Actor win at the Actor Boy Awards for another musical, White
Witch.

As ever, a touch of nostalgia and genuine quality akin to the Great White Way
to our cultural landscape is always welcome, and it would appear that Last Call
is up to the task, judging by a brief dramatic reading of two scenes at the
Talking Trees Literary Fiesta on Saturday. Last Call is an account, split in
two acts, of four best friends who reunite after a decade at the Myrtle Bank’s
main lounge to catch up on each other’s careers and general life developments.
As for the cast, Maurice Bryan, Aisha Davis, Rishille Bellamy-Pelicie, Shayne
Powell – and Andrew Lawrence as a bartender – will take on the roles, while
Scarlett Beharie serves as producer.

King, who has studied screenwriting in the US and even interned in Hollywood,
explains that stories shared by his grandfather (who passed in January) largely
inspired the script, while the music will be a mix of original compositions and
standout selections that mark the period where the play is laid. With the
promise of a production spiked with friendships, vintage sounds and a glossy
piece of Jamaica’s past, no wonder Last Call remains one of the hotly
anticipated plays coming out this year. Opening night: July 29, Philip
Sherlock Centre, UWI Mona.
