Beauty queen and television personality Yendi Phillipps is adding yet another
title.

Come July 12, she will make her acting debut in Keiran King's latest production
Taboo.

"I have a theatre background, in terms of dance theatre. But I have always been
intrigued to delve further and explore other elements of the arts so I went
after the role," Phillipps tells the Sunday Observer.

According to King, she was put through the same audition process as the other
aspirants.

"We were looking for young attractive persons to play the females leads in a
play about sex and relationships. We put it to her, not knowing whether or not
she had the acting chops. She gave a very good audition. She brings a
tremendous energy which makes the cast gel," says King.

Phillipps, first runner-up in Miss Universe 2010 and a top 16 finisher in the
Miss World 2007, said her biggest challenge is remembering her lines.

"I work in live television where I read from a teleprompter and ad lib when I
need to. But sticking to a script, especially one written by Keiran [King] who
is a stickler for detail, is proving to be a challenge. But I'm up to it," she
said.

Phillipps will play opposite seasoned actors King, Rodney Campbell and Lisa
Williams.

Taboo, an adults-only drama, is about two young couples navigating the world of
sex and relationships. The play is directed by Eugene Williams.

So how do you mentally prepare for role in a production that could be
considered racy?

"I have no struggle with the role or the production. The beauty of the arts is
that it brings the reality of life to the fore. In my days with the NDTC
[National Dance Theatre Company], I once played the role of a prostitute in a
piece choreographed by Professor Rex Nettleford, so it is really no different,"
she added.
