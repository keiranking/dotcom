Former Miss Jamaica World (2007) and Miss Jamaica Universe (2010) Yendi
Phillipps will make her theatre debut in the Backstory production, Taboo.
Billed as being smart, funny and sexy, it also features Rodney Campbell, Lisa
Williams (Ghett'a Life) and Keiran King.

The script is written by Keiran King (Last Call, Mr & Mrs Blacke) and crafted
for the stage by veteran director Eugene Williams (Ruined).

"We have a tremendous cast that each brings a unique energy to the set," said
playwright Keiran King. "Rodney's playful machismo, Lisa's sweet charm and
Yendi's bouncy optimism make it such a joy to be at rehearsal. It is a humbling
and challenging experience working with such talented performers under Eugene's
direction. Everything he says reveals years of experience."

In this adults only drama, two young Jamaican couples try to navigate the
mixed-up world of sex and relationships. Taboo opens July 12 at the Sherlock.

Backstory is a production company with a simple goal - to create Jamaican
stories that can travel the world without apology. Previous productions were
Last Call and Mr & Mrs Blacke.
