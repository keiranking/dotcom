After four decades on and around Capitol Hill, [Michael Boland] knew policy was made through connections and compromise. In the rancor and polarization of the Obama and Trump years, he saw an opportunity to build a tool to help folks reach across the aisle.

When I met Boland, he'd spent three years on Dome, and tapped [Michael Babyak], former Director of Marketing Technology for the RNC, to lead product development.

But despite time, money, talent and passion, Dome didn't have a single user. Investors were anxious. What was wrong, and could it be fixed?

As a product strategy consultant, it was my job to find out.

## Dome Wasn't Built in a Day

> Startups have a true north, a destination in mind. I call that a startup's <b>vision</b>. To achieve that vision, startups employ a <b>strategy</b>, which includes a business model, a product roadmap, a point of view about partners and competitors, and ideas about who the customer will be. The <b>product</b> is the end result.

>  Eric Ries, *The Lean Startup*

There were three reasons the Dome team had failed to attract users:

1. They knew what they were doing (faith v user research/testing).
1. They wanted to bring people together (network effects).
1. They wanted to make a good first impression (waterfall v lean dev).>

Boland had a clear vision: to put the civility back in civil service. But his strategy, to transform his political savvy into a web app, lacked focus. The result was a series of pivots, starting from a database of lobbyist money and ending with its current incarnation as a social network.

Software is a solution. If it solves a problem better than the alternatives, people use it. Ride-hailing apps provide an easier, safer alternative to taxis. News websites are more convenient and timely than their print cousins. If Dome was to succeed, we needed to know:

- whose problem we wanted to solve (our target market)
- which problem we wanted to solve (our value proposition)

The team decided to focus on freshman staffers, acclimatizing to a world of constituents and committees.

But what problems did new staffers face? And which ones could we solve better than anyone else? To answer these questions, I headed to Capitol Hill.

## Heading

> In my Toyota interviews, when I asked what distinguishes the Toyota Way from other management approaches, the most common first response was *genchi gembutsu*. You cannot be sure you really understand any part of any business problem unless you <b>go and see for yourself</b> firsthand.

> Jeffrey Liker, *The Toyota Way*

Our very first interviews taught us why the app wasn't getting traction. Members of Congress, for whom staffers worked, needed to control the flow of information to limit scandal and embarrassment. Staffers avoided apps like Facebook and Twitter for fear of being the source of a leak.

Dome had built a social network for perhaps the only group of Americans who wouldn't touch them with a ten-foot stylus.

Even without that constraint, a new social app would struggle to overcome <b>[the network effect]</b> that affects all marketplaces. People use Instagram because other people use Instagram. The first Dome user would only be able to talk to themselves.

## Vote Yes on Value Proposition 14

What Dome needed was a <b>[value proposition]</b> independent of network effects, something the first user could benefit from as much as the millionth.

As we spoke to young Democrats and Republicans, a few candidate problems emerged:

- Staffers were overwhelmed by all the lunches, brunches, seminars, lectures, symposia and meet-and-greets happening somewhere in the maze of federal buildings each week.

- blah
