I make crosswords in my spare time. The industry standard is [Crossword Compiler] — $170 and Windows-only. While at [Recurse Center], [Raph Levien] and I built [Phil], a free, fast puzzle-maker.

Phil imports and exports `.puz` files, uses a high-quality custom dictionary, and can generate a printable NYT submission in seconds.
