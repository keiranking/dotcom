You’re here to read a review of the new *Harry Potter* movie. And you’ll get
one.

But first, Palace Amusement wants you to know they have a card that can save you
time. Also, the tabloid *Chat!* says hi; Burger King wants you to buy Whoppers;
Guardian Life asks for your money; Digicel reminds you it is bigger and better
(than what?); KingAlarm hawks their security systems; Claro sings about their 3G
network (whatever that is); KIG claims to sell cars, although it’s not clear
which ones; and Palace Amusement says they have more cards — gift cards this
time. They will also host your child’s birthday party.

If you found that annoying, don’t go to the cineplex.

And now, the review. Here’s the truth. You’ve read all seven of J. K. Rowling’s
books. You’ve watched at least one of the previous five movies in the franchise.
You, or your child, or your spouse, threw both hands triumphantly in the air
when you saw the TV promotional spots. And, regardless of what is printed here,
you’re going to go and see *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*.

Fortunately, the movie is highly watchable. Sturdy, even. As far as these
spectacles go, it’s positively masterful. Tightly plotted, appropriately
macabre, surprisingly witty. The trouble with adapting the *Potter* stories is
that everyone already knows what happens. *Titanic* (1997) navigated that
obstacle by putting Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio at the prow, *The Passion
of the Christ* (2004) by obsessing over visceral detail. Director David Yates
and series scribe Steve Kloves, handling a truly sacred text, instead tweak
*Half-Blood Prince* to create unexpected, fresh moments.

One comes early, when Harry flirts with a waitress in a Muggle diner, only to be
interrupted by his Hogwarts headmaster, Dumbledore. Magic was Harry’s escape
from reality; now the real world reveals its own charms. Hormones run high
throughout *Half-Blood Prince* — Hermione, Ron and Harry all have uncomfortable
moments with each other (not least when Ron, having imbibed a love potion, jumps
into Harry’s bed).

The romantic comedy bits provide welcome relief from the dark thrills and black
magic of *Half-Blood Prince*. More than the earlier installments, though less
than the novel, the film lingers on ugly instincts — fear and revenge, pride and
prejudice, power and greed.

Around 1940, with war close at hand, many German filmmakers emigrated to
Hollywood. Their expressionistic aesthetic fused with American paranoia to
create *film noir* — cheap crime thrillers with high-contrast lighting, oblique
camera angles and a persistent sense of pessimism, suspicion and gloom.

A similar sensibility pervades *Half-Blood Prince*, with its Dark Arts,
dementors and Death Eaters, so Yates and his cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel
borrow the *film noir* look. Hogwarts has never been so menacing — cathedral
windows cast prison-bar shafts of light onto cold stone passages. Many scenes
are staged at night. Even the posters for the film betray the heritage, its text
askew, its heroes half-hidden.

Warner Bros. spent more than US$150 million just to market and distribute *Harry
Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, trying to get people excited enough to line
up and buy tickets. This time, the excitement is warranted. But try to be late.
With a little luck (drink some *Felix Felicis*), you’ll skip the ads.
