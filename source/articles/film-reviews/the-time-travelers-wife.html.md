It may have taken NASA until 1969 to put men on the moon, but moviegoers had
been travelling there since 1902, thanks to Georges Melies’ _Le Voyage dans la
Lune_. To modern eyes, the footage looks like cardboard and plaster, but
contemporary audiences sat in rapture, enthralled by its otherworldliness. Most
of us cannot afford to leave Jamaica’s shores, but for six hundred dollars, we
can travel around the world (this week’s destinations include Venezuela (_Up_)
and South Africa (_District 9_)).

The tricks of the camera and the soundstage have always fascinated us, and so
the people who make movies have always strived for new ways to fascinate —
remember _The Matrix_ (1999)? But in an age of ubiquitous special effects, where
hundred-million-dollar budgets are a dime a dozen, and the Internet makes us all
explorers, mere spectacle is not enough.

Thus _The Time Traveler’s Wife_, while indulging in one of cinema’s oldest
tricks — making people vanish — recognizes it must also tell a good story. Clare
Abshire (played by Brooklyn Proulx and Rachel McAdams, bewitching as always)
grew up as many little girls do, dreaming of the man — tall, strong and handsome —
who would appear one day. In Clare’s case, however, those days are many, since
her husband, Henry, who can travel through time, keeps appearing and
disappearing.

The film slowly opens the possibilities of its central gimmick. Henry DeTamble
(Eric Bana, the most striking librarian in the history shelves) can’t control
his transcendent transportation, leading to moments opportune — escaping a car
crash — and not so opportune — getting to the church in time becomes a double
entendre.

_The Time Traveler’s Wife_ raises as many questions as it settles, with Clare
telling Henry about memories he has yet to experience. It doesn’t explain why
Henry, though altering timelines, never seems to change them. And it never tells
us how or why he is able to blast from the past back to the future and home
again.

But the grey matter doesn’t matter, because _The Time Traveler’s Wife_ isn’t
about the time traveller — it’s about his wife, and by extension, about all
American wives (and if Jamaican women can find points of connection, that’s an
unintended bonus). The film stays with Clare even when her husband does not,
showing her eating alone at a table set for two, and lying alone in their
king-size bed, and waiting, too often, for too long, for her husband to come
home.

In this way, _The Time Traveler’s Wife_ provides a commentary on the modern
middle-class marriage, with two careers and two cars and one too many evenings
spent at the office. Even by our relatively equal standards, men usually earn
more than their wives, and spend more time doing so, leaving women feeling as if
their husbands are unintentional time travellers, subject to the arbitrary
dictates of the company and the stock price.

Hollywood will always take us to long-gone ages and faraway places, but _The
Time Traveler’s Wife_ serves as a timely reminder that its greatest power lies
in stories of the here and now.
