Today, we’re going to learn how to make a successful Nora Ephron movie.

First, you will need to find, adapt or invent two people who are superficially
opposites, and separated by a difficult-to-overcome barrier — attitudes (on
relationships, *When Harry Met Sally*, 1989) or distance (a continental delta,
*Sleepless in Seattle*, 1993) or a medium (the Internet, *You’ve Got Mail*,
1998) or time (fifty years in her new film, *Julie & Julia*).

Second, you must keep your characters apart, ensuring they meet infrequently
(every five years in *When Harry Met Sally*), accidentally (at the Empire State
Building in *Sleepless in Seattle*), unknowingly (on the street in *You’ve Got
Mail*) or, in the case of *Julie & Julia*, never.

Third, having set the odds massively against them, you carefully blend their
stories and let it sit for two hours, finding the spiritual essence that binds
them together — deep affection (*When Harry Met Sally*), a hole in the heart
(*Sleepless in Seattle*) or a shared passion (for reading in *You’ve Got Mail*;
for cooking in *Julie & Julia*).

Voila! Your very own romantic dramedy, just like *Julie & Julia*, the interwoven
lives of Julia Child, real-life American diplomat’s wife who became famous for
her French cookbooks, and Julie Powell, struggling New York City writer who
gained a cult following by spending a year cooking her way through all 527
recipes in Child’s magnum opus, *Mastering the Art of French Cooking*.

Ephron’s movies, though insightful in a pop-psychology kind of way, are never
particularly complicated. Julie & Julia are both married to doting husbands
ordinary enough to consider themselves lucky. They are both searching for
purpose in worlds which make them feel lost — post-WWII Paris for Julia, and
post-9/11 New York for Julie. Julia doesn’t understand a word anyone around her
says, and an early restaurant scene with Julie’s yuppie friends tells us she
doesn’t, either.

Within these similar but disparate contexts, the two women discover the joys and
heartaches of cooking (while the husbands discover heartburn). Important tip:
Using better ingredients improves the recipe. Whether an Ephron film works
usually depends on its co-stars. In the aforementioned hits, Meg Ryan was, to
paraphrase Julia Child, the butter to Billy Crystal and Tom Hanks’s bread.
*Bewitched* (2005) failed partly because Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell lacked
chemistry.

In *Julie & Julia*, Meryl Streep and Amy Adams are like a Cabernet Sauvignon and
camembert cheese — distinct tastes that grow well together. It’s impossible to
go over-the-top playing Julia Child, so Streep’s affectations, which sometimes
grate in other roles, work here. She also has the freedom (like peers Robert
DeNiro, Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman) of a guaranteed audience bloc — the
patrons at Palace Cineplex were middle-aged or older.

More weight rests on Amy Adams, scrabbling out of the gutter of television
sitcoms and cable dramas (*The Office, That 70s Show, Smallville, Charmed*),
aspiring to the A-list apex of crossovers Jennifer Aniston and George Clooney.
Her turn as Julie Powell is competent, but nothing to write a homepage about.
However, her listless yet histrionic blogger is the right foil for Streep’s
bubbly but bourgeois housewife.

With any culinary exercise, the last step is always, of course, to consume the
dish. *Julie & Julia*, without being subtle or aiming for *jouissance*, leaves a
rich, dreamy aftertaste.
