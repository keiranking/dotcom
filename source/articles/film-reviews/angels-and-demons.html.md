Just as a priest feels during Carnival or a professor feels during Christmas, so
a cinéphile feels during the summer — everyone else is enjoying themselves, and
you’re the only one seeing the mindless rituals for what they are.

For summer is blockbuster season, when the six American majors (Sony, 20th
Century Fox, Warner Brothers, Paramount, Universal and Dreamworks SKG) release
their tentpole pictures — the sinfully expensive, lavishly marketed mega-movies
that determine the financial health of their parents. One *Titanic* (20th
Century Fox/Paramount) or *Spider-Man* (Sony) or *The Dark Knight* (Warner
Bros.) can single-handedly offset a year’s worth of box office flops.

Since a tentpole film is potential manna from heaven, the studios ram-pack it
with every imaginable attraction — nudity, sexuality, violence, foul language,
drugs — all the things on the rating labels, which are advertisements disguised
as warnings (Don’t see this movie — it has SEX! GRAPHIC SEX!).

Of course, this sardine approach to filmmaking doesn’t exactly churn out
masterpieces, so the studios spend more millions on publicity blitzes, to make
sure we all see the movie at the same time, on its opening weekend, before we
have a chance to tell our friends what a piece of crap it is. And we fall for it
like faithful disciples, nattering excitedly about this movie or that, gushing
about what we have to see and can’t afford to miss.

At its worst, this means execrable fluff like *Hannah Montana: The Movie*
(Disney), in which a 16-year-old actress caught between childhood and Hollywood
plays a 16-year-old actress caught between childhood and Hollywood, her
innocence and privacy sacrificed at the altar of global commercialism. (Disney
sells *Montana*-themed clothes, watches, bedding, luggage, shoes, makeup, spa
kits, and toys. Last year Miley Cyrus, then 15, personally earned more than
US$25,000,000. Yes, that’s the right number of zeroes.)

At its best, however, we get *Angels & Demons* (Sony), a thriller that lives up
to its name and its ampersand, with compelling (though not complicated)
dualities between science and theology, logic and faith, modernity and
antiquity. And, yes, good and evil, though as the film reminds us in its crash
course through Catholic history, deciding which is which is usually in the eye
of the beheader.

*Angels & Demons* is the follow-up to *The Da Vinci Code* (2006), also directed
by Ron Howard, adapted by Akiva Goldsman, scored by Hans Zimmer, and starring
Tom Hanks. Both properties were originally novels by Dan Brown, who wrote
*Angels & Demons* first, making it both a sequel and a prequel, depending on
the medium. Because everyone, including the Pope, read *The Da Vinci Code*,
Brown now rubs shoulders with Stephen King, John Grisham and the other rich,
chosen few to escape the bargain bins at Barnes & Noble.

The Holy Grail for every popular fiction writer is to create a serialized
character that captures the attention of the lonely secretary and the airport
traveler — Jonathan Kellerman unravels stories of child psychologist Alex
Delaware; Sue Grafton unfolds Kinsey Millhone alphabet mysteries; Elizabeth
George investigates Inspector Lynley. These uniformly smart, capable
protagonists are a dime a dozen, which is why you’ve either never heard of them,
or have them stacked beside your bed.

Paperbacks and motion pictures peddle the same diversions, so Dan Brown and Sony
was a match made in, well, heaven. *Angels & Demons*, the film, once again
follows Robert Langdon (Hanks), a Harvard professor of religious iconography, as
he trips along a chain-reaction of Catholic clues embedded in action sequences.

The action academic has its origin in 1930s characters such as bronzed Amazonian
scientist Doc Savage, and has its archetype in Dr. Henry “Indiana” Jones,
archaeologist and adventurer, whose movies were set in the 1930s. Robert Langdon
has neither whip nor hat, only his wits and a decent haircut. At the behest of
the Vatican, he is trying to locate both a small explosive that will obliterate
the Holy See, and four missing Cardinals, the front-runners to become the next
Pope.

What could have been a God-awful mess is intelligently paced by director Howard
(*A Beautiful Mind*) and comfortably inhabited by Hanks. The required kinetics
are motivated by Langdon’s urgent search. In one breathtaking sequence, he must
escape, before he suffocates, from an electronically-operated, oxygen-regulated,
bulletproof, air-tight chamber that has lost power — the Vatican Archives, home
to sacred scientific texts like Galileo’s writings.

Take it from a blaspheming cinéphile — *Angels & Demons* is good, not evil. Just
leave the reverence at the door.
