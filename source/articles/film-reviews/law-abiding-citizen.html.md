By the time the title flashes on the screen, fractured white letters on a black
rectangle, we’ve already witnessed a robbery, an attempted rape and two murders.
Then again, in thrillers like _Law Abiding Citizen_, unpredictable in thoroughly
predictable ways, you expect that kind of trick. But for the handful of you who
still believe in the Easter bunny, let’s make it clear — many, many, many laws
are broken in this movie.

Not that the title is inappropriate. The multiple meanings, pursuit and intent
of the law — and those who profess to uphold it — form the cerebral cortex of
_Law Abiding Citizen_ (at least, the parts of it where no one gets blown to
bits). Jamie Foxx, as Nick Rice, is a young, handsome, pitch-perfect lawyer with
a great conviction rate and an eye on the district attorneyship. You know he’s
good at his job because his suits are impossibly well-tailored and he likes to
converse while descending big marble staircases. Can’t go wrong there.

Gerard Butler plays the victim of most of the crimes in the first paragraph,
Clyde Shelton. Rice settles, on Shelton’s behalf, for one death sentence and one
get-out-of-jailbird, enough for his stats but not enough for Shelton. Thus with
the revenge motive firmly in place, the movie transposes into a head-to-head
between the two men.

Vengeance, like love, is an inexhaustible font for storytellers. _Once Upon a
Time in the West_ (1968) featured legendary knockabout Charles Bronson as a
gunslinger whose brother had been hung. His relentless pursuit of the murderer
righted that wrong, but also represented citizen resistance to corporate greed.
_Death Wish_ (1974) starred (who else?) Bronson as a Manhattan architect whose
wife and daughter are raped and killed by street thugs. His vigilante justice
satisfied his personal loss and stood in for the real class anxiety and
bourgeois fears in 1970s New York.

_Law Abiding Citizen_, by contrast, lacks originality, a topical social
context, and Charles Bronson, any one of which might have saved the picture.
Shelton’s quest, while entertaining, seems wildly disproportionate to his loss
and highly improbable (the script makes him rich just so he has enough money to
keep blowing stuff up). In addition, his system of retribution has the same
evils as the marble-encrusted one he despises, killing relative innocents and
meting out uneven punishments.

Crucially, in a film rife with transgressions, _Law Abiding Citizen_ adheres to
every tired law of Hollywood thrillers — black guy vs white guy (_Crimson Tide,
Along Came a Spider_); criminal mastermind in jail (_Silence of the Lambs_);
races against the clock (_Nick of Time, 16 Blocks_); car bombs (_The Pelican
Brief_); loved ones in danger (_12 Rounds, Die Hard_); lots and lots of police
vehicles (_The Fugitive, Enemy of the State_).

Butler is no Bronson, but he delivers a much more energetic performance than
Foxx, who merely squints and grimaces his way through the film. Although Foxx
may have been thinking about the mediocrity of _Law Abiding Citizen_, and how he
could recover from it… without breaking any laws of celebrity.
