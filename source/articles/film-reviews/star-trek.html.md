Let’s start with the obvious and the obligatory: _Star Trek_, the new American
movie, not to be confused with the 1966 television series _Star Trek_, or the
four series it spawned, or the 1979 movie _Star Trek_, or any of its nine
sequels, meekly goes where every blockbuster picture has gone before, and must
go, and will continue to go.

Which means, in no particular order: young, attractive Caucasian lead actors
(because it must sell in West Virginia); one token Black American supporting
actor (because it must sell in West Harlem); loud noises, explosions and special
effects (because it must sell to young men); unnecessary female nudity (ditto);
fight scenes, sex scenes, chase scenes (ditto, ditto, ditto); catchphrases
(because it must feel familiar); fancy camerawork and editing (because it must
feel new); a foreign-sounding enemy (because Americans like to collect them);
and the promise of a sequel (because Mercedes don’t buy themselves).

This blow-stuff-up, blow-up doll, shrink-wrapped form of entertainment
short-circuits our synapses, and after a while we get used to the idea that
we’re not supposed to think when we’re at the movies. This works very well for
the major movie studios, run disproportionately by healthy, wealthy men from Los
Angeles who understand, even though they’d never touch the stuff themselves,
that ice cream will always sell because it feels good while you’re eating it.
Never mind that it’s bad for us; we’ll eat it, anyway.

Hollywood makes the filmic equivalent of triple chocolate sundaes with sprinkles
and syrup and two cherries on top — movies that are really, really bad for us,
but feel so good while we’re watching that we keep coming back. As with ice
cream, the damage is done a little bit at a time, so we can always justify one
more indulgence.

Here’s the plot summary for _Star Trek_, if you need to know. James Kirk, from
Iowa (ticket sales!), is a rebel whose father martyred himself in a battle
(check!) against an evil race (double check!), the Romulans. (The bad guys in
the original series, circa America’s Korean and Vietnamese invasions, looked
Oriental; in this movie, unsurprisingly, they look vaguely Arabic.) James gets
talked into joining the Starfleet, where he flirts with a girl named Uhura,
befriends a man named Leonard McCoy and outwits an alien named Spock. Either
those names mean something to you, and you’ll get excited watching them spout
ridiculous dialogue, or they don’t, and you won’t. And, yeah, James eventually
fights the Romulans.

May now marks the beginning of the summer blockbuster season, which has crept
earlier and earlier as studios fight to be first. Last week’s megamovie was
_Wolverine_, or _X-Men 4_; this week is _Star Trek 11_, new and improvised;
still to come are _Transformers 2_, _Ice Age 3_, _Terminator 4_, and _Harry
Potter 6_. Oodles of ice cream.

It’s worth noting that there are filmmakers, with one foot inside and one foot
outside the Hollywood dream factory, who try to make the audience engage their
material and think about stuff. People like Quentin Tarantino (whose World War
II flick, _Inglourious Basterds_ [sic], opens in August), Woody Allen (_Whatever
Works_, in June), Steven Soderbergh (_The Informant_, with Matt Damon, October),
and Sam Mendes (_Revolutionary Road_, hopefully coming soon).

Go see their movies, and skip all the star-filled dreck.
