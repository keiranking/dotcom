_Land of the Lost_ used to be an American television series for children,
airing for three seasons between 1974 and 1976. The show featured a park ranger
and his two children as they explored a parallel world filled with anachronistic
dinosaurs, cavemen, obelisks and time portals. It is now, according to the
immutable laws of Hollywood, a massive motion picture that cost nine billion
Jamaican dollars to make (that’s the actual budget), and casts Will Ferrell as
the intrepid explorer, Rick Marshall. However, the title could equally well
refer to the audiences conned into sitting through this atrocious movie.

A lot of children’s entertainment, including the original _Land of the Lost_
series, is designed around the principle of recreating, or reflecting, the
supposedly fantastical, untethered worldview of children themselves. Hence the
talking puppet monsters _of Sesame Street_, the androgynous playmates on
_Teletubbies_ and so on. Whatever the merits of this approach for kids (a
subject open to debate), pitching the same material at adults is insulting.

And _Land of the Lost_ — the movie — is made for grown-ups, albeit grown-ups who
haven’t quite grown up. It aims for the college fraternity humour that currently
dominates American film comedies — the province of Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider,
Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Michael Cera and, naturally, Will Ferrell. This
aesthetic, where men in their twenties and thirties are stuck in a perpetual
adolescence, thrives on scatalogical jokes, male bonding with an undercurrent of
homophobia, and the misogynistic pairing of pasty, paunchy men with attractive
women.

Two men, on either side of the camera, epitomize this trend. One is Judd Apatow,
with a hand in every recent entrant in the genre — writer of _The 40-Year-Old
Virgin, Knocked Up, You Don’t Mess With the Zohan_ and _Funny People_; producer
of _Superbad, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Pineapple Express_ and a half dozen
more.

The other is Will Ferrell, who has marshalled a long list of not-so-funny
comedies — _Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, Semi-Pro, Step
Brothers_ and now _Land of the Lost_. The Ferrell type remains static — slightly
dimwitted, overly masculine, out of shape, untanned, lacking social etiquette,
childless, immature and overconfident. In other words, a suburban teenager, just
older.

Ferrell, like fellow alums Sandler, Schneider and Mike Myers, honed his craft on
the sketch show _Saturday Night Live_, whose stock-in-trade is the five-minute
skit. But five minutes, stretched to fill 90 minutes, should only get you one or
two movies. After cashing in with a few easy hits, the comedians struggle to
stay fresh and relevant. Adam Sandler has had mixed success with more serious
roles (_Punch-Drunk Love, Reign Over Me_). Ferrell’s attempts to escape his
persona (_Melinda and Melinda, Stranger than Fiction_) failed at the box office —
thus more tired retreads like _Land of the Lost_.

In addition to (or perhaps subtraction from) Ferrell, _Land of the Lost_ has
Danny McBride as yet another pudgy deadbeat, and Anna Friel as cheesecake (she
spends most of her time in pigtails, a tank top and cut-offs). This one should
be deliberately lost in the Universal film archives.
