Amongst people who do not know the director of _Caged Heat_ (1974), the music
from _Across 110th Street_ (1972), or the length of the final car chase in the
original _Gone in 60 Seconds_ (1974) — which is to say, almost everyone —
watching a Quentin Tarantino movie is like listening to classical music:
pleasant in a vague, try-anything-once sort of way, but mostly a reminder of how
ignorant and uncultured you are.

This feeling is perfectly agreeable to film critics, who accumulate this kind of
arcane trivia (Jonathan Demme; soul tracks by Bobby Womack; 34 minutes) and so
think of themselves as pretty smart. But the average moviegoer (yes, we think of
you as average) just wants to be entertained.

In his first three films, _Reservoir Dogs_ (1992), _Pulp Fiction_ (1994) and
_Jackie Brown_ (1997), everyone wins — theatrical, memorable (and excessively
talkative) characters try to stay alive through increasingly hopeless scenarios
while every available shot, location, throwaway line and hand prop provides
inside references for aficionados of world cinema.

His next two endeavours — the double-volume pan-Asian homage _Kill Bill_ (2003
and 2004) and the double-feature ode to 1970s American B-movies, _Grindhouse_
(2007) — overindulged in intertextual density and underwhelmed the public.

_Inglourious Basterds_ heralds Tarantino’s return to form. Structured as a
series of ‘chapters’ telling interconnected stories (like _Pulp Fiction_), the
film defies easy summary. However, here goes: during World War II in
Nazi-occupied Paris, a German film premiere becomes the target of three
offensives, by the French, the British and a group of American combatives known
as The Basterds.

Every Tarantino picture is a post-modern pastiche, and _Inglourious Basterds_ is
no exception. Civil-rights era American war movies like _The Guns of Navarone_
(1961), _The Great Escape_ (1963) and especially _The Dirty Dozen_ (1967)
featured eclectic bands of soldiers who overcome internal differences to battle
a common — invariably German — enemy.

_Inglourious Basterds_, which takes its title from a 1978 Italian copycat of
_The Dirty Dozen_, reproduces the dynamic with a group of mostly Jewish-American
infantrymen cobbled together by a Southern lieutenant with alleged Amerindian
heritage, Aldo Raine (deliciously overplayed by Brad Pitt). Pitt’s character is
brashly, brazenly all-American, in a loose inheritance of similar roles played
by older hunks Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen.

As in his other work, Tarantino eschews an original score in favor of repurposed
tracks from other, older films, including several musical selections by famed
Italian composer Ennio Morricone (_The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_; _Once Upon a
Time in the West_).

Though epic in scale, budget and execution, _Inglourious Basterds_ retains
Tarantino’s trademark rhythm — long stretches of dialogue that explode into
moments of extreme violence. Like any good filmmaker, he keeps making the same
movie over and over without repeating himself. Signature elements clock in
regularly — the inclusion of a Mexican standoff (where three or more characters
point guns at each other) and the dangerous thrill of a woman’s bare feet —
without threatening the integrity of the story.

Tarantino’s relationship with cinema is that of someone towards their spouse of
forty years, which is about how long he’s been watching movies. He can’t help
but adore it — wholeheartedly, unrepentingly, and forever — but also knows its
shortcomings and shortcuts, its successes and failures. He knows it, as a friend
and as an enemy, exploring its boundaries and possibilities. _Inglourious
Basterds_ is another labour of love (ten years in the making) from a man who
wants all of us — even the average ones — to have that feeling.
