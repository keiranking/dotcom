Is it fair to unload years of accumulated frustration on a single film? Is it
fair to expect a movie designed to be profitable to also be profound? Is it fair
to criticize a product for being itself?

In *New in Town*, Renée Zellweger is a high-powered Miami executive whose
higher-powered corporate heads assign her to downsize a food factory in rural
Minnesota. There, she has to battle snow, small-town values and Harry Connick,
Jr., the local union representative. The usual misadventures follow like so many
bland protein bars off the assembly line — she wears stilettos to the plant, she
drives into a snowdrift, she falls in love. Personal desire and professional
ambition dovetail. Transnational financial imperatives and the livelihoods of
the workforce converge. City and country meld. Alan Ladd rides off into the
sunset. Okay, everything except the last bit.

*New in Town* has all the ingredients of a romantic comedy, but director Jonas
Elmer hews too strictly to the recipe printed on the box office. Is it fair to
unload years of accumulated frustration on a single film? Yes. The creative
talent behind the film, including writers Ken Rance and C. Jay Cox (*Sweet Home
Alabama*), failed to get creative, to bend the formula without breaking it.

That is what all great genre films do — they redefine the genre. The old
remarriage romantic comedies of the 1940s, like *His Girl Friday*, had
mile-a-minute repartee; *New in Town* has a thong joke (“No, I said wear
something you can *get* dirty.”). *When Harry Met Sally* (1989) had a pair of
instantly likeable leads in Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan; when Harry meets Renée
in *New in Town*, there’s no spark, just a pair of Hollywood veterans, one
looking old and tired, the other unnaturally young.

And where Ms Zellweger puts her Botox on display, there’s money to be made. Is
it fair to expect a movie designed to be profitable to also be profound? Yes.
*Michael Clayton* (2007) and *Little Miss Sunshine* (2006) were both highly
formulaic, highly successful genre films — a thriller with an easy enemy, the
corporate world, and a family dramedy with a road trip. But their characters and
themes, so carefully crafted, lodged in our minds, in the space reserved for
unsolvable problems and uncomfortable truths. *New in Town* can’t bear the
thought of disappointing its audience; everything works out for everybody, no
matter how improbable the odds and unlikely the choice. Disappointing, no?

Enough, you say. It is what it is — expensively-produced, cheaply consumed,
disposable entertainment. Is it fair to criticize a product for being itself?
No. It is not fair to fault *New in Town* for being a romantic comedy; it is
only fair to fault it for a being a schmaltzy, sloppy, slapdash one. If only the
writer/director of *Michael Clayton*, Tony Gilroy, tried his hand at a romantic
comedy, with witty repartee, and likeable leads, like Clive Owen and Julia
Roberts.

It’s called *Duplicity*, and it arrives new in town in a few weeks.
