At some point, fatigue sets in.

Ever since we figured out that we could all do more if we each did less, most of
us have been delegated (or is it relegated?) to perform specialized tasks over
and over again — most of us, in other words, have jobs. We spend nearly all our
waking hours preparing for, plodding through and recovering from our jobs. And
at some point, some indeterminate but inevitable point, fatigue sets in.

For a teacher, it could hit near the end of the term, while regurgitating arcane
scientific trivia to a roomful of children. For a nurse, it could be during the
graveyard shift, pacing sterile and empty hallways. For a film critic, it is
now, halfway through the summer season, sitting through ordinary yet
over-budgeted orchestrations like _The Proposal_.

Ten weeks ago, the mislabeled romantic comedy _New in Town_ featured a
successful but frigid East Coast female executive in her forties (Renee
Zellweger) who was displaced to a frigid but charming rural outpost (Minnesota),
where she gradually warmed to the handy, handsome local (Harry Connick, Jr).

_The Proposal_, by contrast, is the story of a successful but frigid East Coast
female executive in her forties (Sandra Bullock) who is displaced to a frigid
but charming rural outpost (Alaska), where she gradually warms to the handy,
handsome local (Ryan Reynolds).

Bullock plays Margaret Tate, whose specialized task is making executive
decisions in tight clothes at a major New York publishing company. Reynolds is
her assistant, Andrew Baxter — his job is to fetch cinnamon soy lattes for
Margaret. In danger of being deported to her native Canada, Margaret proposes a
quickie marriage to Andrew, followed by a quickie divorce. A great plan, except
(Spoiler alert!) they fall in love instead.

If nothing else, _The Proposal_ is entertainment conducive to cuddling. Of
course, so is the programming on Music 99 FM, which is free. _The Proposal_ is
also two hours of situational hijinks and light laughs, but so are four
syndicated episodes of _The Dick Van Dyke Show_, which is funnier and, with some
creative channel-surfing, also free (since you’re already paying for cable). You
don’t like your job, so don’t spend the money you made there on this movie.

The reason so many bad films get made is that everyone involved — the director
(Anne Fletcher), the stars, the movie executives — can bank on our fatigue. They
know that, as soon as we punch out, we tune out. We don’t really care if the
movie is any good or not — at least it’s not work.

At the risk of inducing a midlife crisis, consider this question. Why are we so
desperate for distractions like _The Proposal_? Are we so mortified about the
consequences of quiet contemplation that we must fill all our available leisure
time with liquor and libido, tickets and television? So what if our jobs force
us to compromise childhood dreams — we can’t all be astronaut rock stars. Skip
_The Proposal_, and live with it.
