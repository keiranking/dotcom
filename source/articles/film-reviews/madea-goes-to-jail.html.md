It’s easy to forget, inundated as we are by film after film after film depicting
the lives of young, white American urban and suburban professionals, just how
affirmatory going to the cinema can be.

We are all stuck in this big, crazy world, stuck with the same struggles and
triumphs, heartbreaks and hopes. We all try to make sense of lives that seem
fundamentally anarchic and arbitrary. Some of us have religion. Some of us have
degrees. But all of us have the movies. We recognize ourselves on the screen,
our experiences carefully pared, parsed and shaped into compelling stories. Art
doesn’t only imitate life; it explicates it.

The only problem for us, living in Jamaica, is that most of the movies at the
cineplex are like funhouse mirrors — you can kinda see yourself if you look from
the right perspective, but it’s badly distorted. We recognize love; we don’t
recognize Manhattan lofts. We identify with death; we don’t identify with Denver
snow.

That’s why Tyler Perry is so invaluable.

Not because he makes great movies — he doesn’t. Not because his movies make a
lot of money — although they do. Tyler Perry is invaluable because he uses
cinematic pixie dust to turn authentic black experience into authentic
black-oriented art. Also, because Madea is funny as hell (where she’ll probably
end up).

*Madea Goes to Jail* is the latest film entry in Perry’s lucrative drag
franchise. He developed the Madea character several years ago on the Atlanta,
Georgia urban theatre circuit as a no-nonsense, sharp-tongued but benevolent
grandmother. Perry cross-dresses to play Madea himself, adding to the lengthy
roster of African-American men who have donned lipstick and leggings. It is a
sad peculiarity of the American psyche that its black men must neuter
themselves to be palatable to white audiences — Nat King Cole was soft and
genial; Sidney Poitier, clean-cut and upright. Cross-dressing negates the
supposed sexual threat of a virile black man; it’s not a coincidence that Perry
stands an impressive six-foot-five.

However, Perry is smart enough to pull a bait-and-switch. *Norbit* this is not.
Madea features only tangentially in *Jail* and other films. Perry uses his game
granny to pack the house, but once the seats are full, he turns the cinema into
a church to preach uplifting messages about the importance of family, community
spirit and strong Christian faith.

*Madea Goes to Jail* is really about a young lawyer on the rise, Joshua Hardaway
(played by Derek Luke) and a woman of the night, Candy (Keshia Knight Pulliam,
who played Rudy on *The Cosby Show* and is still trying to cast off its
shadow). They meet because Candy is charged with prostitution and the docket
lands on Joshua’s desk. Joshua, engaged, is thrown back into his past, where he
and Candy share a troubling secret.

Perry wrote, directed and produced the film, which also features David and
Tamela Mann, Ion Overman, Viola Davis and Vanessa Ferlito. Go and see it, and
then go and rent *Meet the Browns* or anything from the Perry oeuvre. They’re
not masterpieces, but it’s better than buying a mirror. You’ve never looked so
good.
