Let’s get some basics out of the way. _The Spirit_ is based on a series of
graphic novels created by Will Eisner in 1940, and brought to the big screen by
Frank Miller. Eisner and Miller are two of the best-known names in the
sequential art industry. Eisner is a legend and innovator, having elevated the
comic book medium with unconventional stories of urban life and blight. Miller
used to ink dark, psychological comic book sagas in the 1970s and 80s, wrote a
couple of _Robocop_ sequels in the 1990s and now, evidently in vogue in
Hollywood, spends his time creating dark, unwatchable movies. He seems to be
getting paid more for doing less the older he gets.

A graphic novel, by the way, is like a comic book, except it’s for grown-ups
(which means kids read them). In a graphic novel, Veronica would come after
Archie with a knife.

In _The Spirit_, a policeman, Denny Colt, who lives in a nameless, faceless
American city, dies and is injected with a serum by his unscrupulous coroner.
The serum gives him a second life with enhanced healing powers. He confides in
his police commissioner and becomes a shadowy, masked appendage to the force
known only as the Spirit.

The movie is bad. It is so bad, so overwhelmingly bad, that the rest of this
space must be used to scare you away from it. The city the Spirit inhabits is an
anachronistic mash-up of 1960s design and present-day technology — so the cars,
trucks and planes look forty years old, all rivets and metal sheets, and the men
wear fedoras, but they use sleek cell phones and the Internet. The Spirit
displays inhuman acrobatics and physical resilience, yet comes close to death,
yet voluntarily chooses to live on. All of this is incredibly disorienting,
leaving the viewer confused about where, when and why events are taking place,
and ignorant about the parameters of the world. Can the Spirit die? If so, how?
Do we even care?

The movie’s awfulness, however, goes beyond its lack of coherence and therefore
lack of drama. _The Spirit_ is emblematic of so much that is wrong with our
cultural landscape. It is one of a thousand pieces of entertainment detritus
littering our minds. Or, to switch analogies, like a sausage — preprocessed,
churned out of a factory, indistinct, artificially shaped, coloured and
flavoured to look appealing, palatable in very small doses and sickening in
excess.

The film euphemistically markets itself as ‘from the producers of _300_ and _Sin
City_’ — in other words, the same rich guys who already cashed in on the
marginal stylistic cleverness of _Sin City_ are still trying the milk, and bilk,
the public. Originality, today, is just a financial opportunity. It is seized
upon, imitated, duplicated, replicated until even the original appears
quotidian.

Why do we tolerate such a marketplace? Have we been so thoroughly trained by our
television sets, car radios and magazines? Is our demand to be amused so
insatiable that we voluntarily subject ourselves to the visual and auditory
assault that is _The Spirit_ and its ilk? Or are we still able, however dimly,
to recognize that what is ‘out there’ is of our collective creation? For our own
sake, our own spirit, one hopes so.
