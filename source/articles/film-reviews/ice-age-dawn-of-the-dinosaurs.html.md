Go to *Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs* and you will be handed a pair of glasses
that looks like it fell out of *Back to the Future* — large, square and quirky.
The weird spectacles are for the spectacle of watching the film in three
dimensions — so when the sabertooth Diego gets going, he literally leaps off the
screen. As the first film screened in Jamaica using digital 3D projection, any
discussion of *Ice Age 3* has to start with technology.

Digital 3D is the latest attempt by American film distributors (like *Ice Age*’s
20th Century Fox) and global film exhibitors (in Jamaica, that means Palace
Amusement) to lure people to the cineplex. In geological time, it comes hot on
the heels of other gimmicks like sound (1927), color (1929), old-fashioned 3D
images (1952) and widescreen (1953).

Those changes were panicked responses to falling attendance (the Great
Depression in the 1930s) and disruptive technologies (television in the 1950s).
Times change. Now movie execs are worried about falling attendance (the global
recession) and disruptive technologies (broadband Internet access and Blu-Ray
discs). Guess it’s time to trot out widescreen 3D movies again.

The first anaglyphic 3D film, 1952’s *Bwana Devil*, promised viewers ‘a lion in
your lap.’ That same year, theatres showing Cinerama widescreen gushed that ‘you
won’t be gazing at a movie screen — you’ll find yourself swept right into the
picture.’ Half a century later, *Ice Age 3* gives us a tiger, while the press
release from Palace Amusement wants us to ‘get ready for the movie experience
that puts you smack dab in the picture.’ Sound familiar?

To be fair, *Ice Age 3* is a more immersive experience than, say, *Ice Age 2*.
Depth perception makes the desolate icescapes more sepulchral and the chase
sequences more immediate — when Diego hunts an antelope early in the film, the
camera hurtles along for the naked adrenaline rush. And the limited viewing
angle and ghosted images that plagued analog 3D have been banished — every seat
gets a sharp image.

But immersion is not investment (although Palace’s accountants might beg to
differ). No amount of whiz-bang gadgetry can fake a good story. Diego’s chase
pales in comparison to the wildebeest stampede in the hand-drawn,
two-dimensional *The Lion King* (what is it with jungle cats, anyway?) — three
minutes of absolute terror as a young child, facing death, is saved by his
father only to see him murdered, as in *Hamlet*, by his uncle. It would have
been riveting with sock puppets.

The plot in *Ice Age 3* skates on thin ice. Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) is
taken away by a Tyrannosaurus, forcing the rest of the herd — woolly mammoths
Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah), opposums Crash and Eddie, and
Diego (Denis Leary) — on a rescue mission. Which would have been fine, except
Ellie is massively pregnant. And there’s a tropical jungle *under the ice* that
nobody noticed until now.

So what? It’s harmless fun for kids. That’s why, of the two female characters,
one is knocked up and the other is a shrew, prompting both Diego and rock rat
Scrat to flee the supposed confines of domesticity. Harmlessly teaching our
young men that monogamy and marriage are to be endured, not enjoyed.

*Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs* — three-dimensional image, one-dimensional
story.
