It’s hard to say which is more absurd: the 1985 animated television series _G.I.
Joe: A Real American Hero_, or the new mega-movie _G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra_.
We’ll decide after a quick primer.

Hasbro is a big American toy company — only rival Mattel is larger. Hasbro sells
Monopoly, Scrabble, Pictionary, Clue, Trivial Pursuit and dozens of other
household brands — Tonka, Tinkertoys, Nerf, Mr. Potato Head, Play-Doh,
Transformers and so on. The people who run Hasbro are very, very rich.

In 1963, jealous of Mattel’s success with Barbie, Hasbro launched a line of
12-inch soldier dolls for boys — Action Soldier, Action Sailor, Action Pilot and
Action Marine (hence _action figure)_. The original G.I. Joes flew off the
shelves until America flew into Laos and Cambodia — preventing both Hasbro and
the White House from selling war for the next decade-and-a-half.

G.I. Joe redeployed in 1985 with smaller molds and smarter marketing (to be
copied by George W. Bush after 9/11) — now they were an elite international
force defending “human freedom against a ruthless terrorist organization.” There
were comic books and a TV show, _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero_, which ran
weekdays on the networks. (Washington prefers to demonize al-Qaida in
prime-time.) Once again, Hasbro couldn’t stamp the plastic figurines fast
enough.

_A Real American Hero_ was everything the rest of the world (that’s us!)
dislikes about Americans — loud, simplistic, disingenuous and culturally
tone-deaf. For instance, the ethnic-cleansing names for some of the white
characters — Cutter, Torch and Sgt. Slaughter — juxtaposed with the Native
American Joe, code-named Spirit (what else?), who sported braids, epigrammatic
English and a pet eagle, Freedom. The Joes were not scared high-school dropouts
of all races from low-income towns (like the real American “heroes”), but
fearless, steroid-pumped Aryan musclemen.

Of course, racist war propaganda will only entertain children for so long. The
_American Hero_ line was retired in 1994. Which brings us to Lorenzo di
Bonaventura, Hasbro’s Hollywood honcho, the man responsible for the two
_Transformers_ movies just past, _G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra_ right now, and
millions of toy sales in the future.

_The Rise of Cobra_ can best be described as a wall of noise and sound for
people who like to bang their heads into walls, transporting a team of Joes from
a green-screen Sahara Desert to a green-screen underwater base to a green-screen
North Pole to, well, it doesn’t even matter. Channing Tatum, who plays Duke,
defends the movie’s awfulness this way: “It’s a huge, 170-million-dollar movie.
It’s just a big, kid sort-of driven film.” Oh. Okay, then. Paramount, _who made
and promoted the movie_, refused to even screen the film for American critics.
It’s as if your husband said you didn’t look fat, and then traded the car for a
forklift.

To answer the absurdity question, the movie is worse, even though in one episode
of the TV show, a dog saves the Joes by using his paws to pump a handcar out of
a mineshaft.

_G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra_ centers around a swarm of nano-bug-things that
can eat a city. Yes, you read that right. It doesn’t spoil anything to tell you
they try to eat Paris. There are costumed freaks trying to spill the bugs — the
Baroness, Storm Shadow, the Doctor — and costumed freaks trying to kill the bugs —
Duke, Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake Eyes and Heavy Duty. They fight — in the air, on
the ground, under the water. Nobody really wins, except Hasbro. Nobody really
loses, except us.

All that’s left to say is: Go, _Joe_. Please go.
