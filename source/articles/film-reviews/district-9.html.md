You’ve never seen anything like *District 9*.

Hyperbole is the root of all movie promotion, so you might read that line with
the cynicism of someone accustomed to media that over-promises and
under-delivers. Every Hollywood blockbuster, desperate to recoup its bloated
budget, claims to be amazing. (*G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra*, which could
replace waterboarding in military prisons as an effective method of torture,
effervesces that “saving the world has never been this much fun.”)

Even tolerable summer flicks, like *Fighting*, have too much Tinseltown DNA to
stand out in a crowded cineplex. (*G.I. Joe* and *Fighting*, for instance, both
star Channing Tatum.) Jamaican audiences, raised from birth on American fare, no
longer expect originality or variance, just the coddling familiarity of the
Universal globe, MGM lion or Warner Bros. crest.

But the white TriStar horse is the first and last familiar image you’ll see in
*District 9*. After that, you’re in the middle of Johannesburg, South Africa.
And not some jungle-shack, studio-backlot, James-Bond version of Africa. The
uncomfortable, sweltering cacophony of seven million people living and working
together. The authentic specificity of Johannesburg — from the high-rises of the
Central Business District to the squat shanties of Soweto — populated by its
unique, post-apartheid ethnic spectrum — Afrikaner, *bruinmense*, immigrant. The
Afrikaans-accented English. The closed-circuit cameras on the street corners.
The *Kwaito* music.

The alien mothership hovering over the city.

That’s right. *District 9* is a science fiction movie, an instant classic taking
its place in the galaxy of *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968), *Star Wars* (1977),
*Alien* (1979) and *Blade Runner* (1982). In the process, its young, South
African writer/director, Neill Blomkamp, inherits the genre from the men behind
those movies — Stanley Kubrick (dead), George Lucas (might as well be) and
Ridley Scott (still going strong).

The genius of *District 9* lies in how Blomkamp uses his hometown to tell a
familiar story about extraterrestrials, and uses extratrerrestrials to tell a
familiar story about his hometown. The aliens, having arrived twenty years ago,
live in a massive fenced-off slum directly beneath their defunct ship — a
temporary humanitarian effort gone permanently wrong — called District Nine.
Now, they are treated like animals, or else like children, or else like savage
brutes.

The government, under political pressure, is relocating the aliens outside the
city. The man in charge is a meek civil employee, Wikus Van de Merwe (Sharlto
Copley). Wikus is about to have a very, very bad day at work, the kind of day
that makes you want to blow up your headquarters.

Blomkamp busts open the barely-congealed wounds of apartheid and rubs some
Soweto dirt in them for good measure. The police freely abuse the aliens, whom
they call *prawns*. When a discerning *prawn* refuses to sign his eviction
notice, Wikus threatens to take his child away. City signs threaten and confine
them: FOR HUMAN USE ONLY.

As a result, *District 9*, despite truckloads of special effects and movie
trickery, feels more honest, more immediate, more out-and-out real than
*Sarafina* (no one in *District 9* has time for singing or Whoopi Goldberg).
Blomkamp uses security cameras and documentary crews to heighten the
it’s-really-happening aesthetic (technical term: cinema verite), tucking his
computer-generated creatures into the background of newsfootage and out-of-focus
citizen journalism.

It all adds up to something you’ve never seen before — the world’s first alien
apartheid allegory. Go see it.
