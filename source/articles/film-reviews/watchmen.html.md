Superheroes and superstars have three things in common — they enjoy the fickle,
fleeting adoration of legions of fans, they are held to a higher moral standard
than the rest of us, and they seem incapable of calling it quits. That’s why,
when Bruce Wayne shuts down his basement Batcave in _The Dark Knight_, when
Peter Parker tosses his latex in the garbage in _Spider-Man 2_, when Bob and
Helen Parr are relegated to stultifying suburbia in _The Incredibles_, our sixth
sense tingles — we know it’s a matter of time before the cape and cowl go back
on.

That sense of anticipation runs through the first half of _Watchmen_, an
ambitious, heavy-handed American dystopia set in an alternate 1985. Through an
exquisitely-crafted early sequence, we see that America has decisively won the
Vietnam conflict, Richard Nixon is still President, and that the Cold War is
heating up. The US and USSR are watching each other with twitchy trigger-fingers
on their nuclear arsenals. Masked vigilantes, once revered, have now been
imprisoned, institutionalized or disbanded.

Lost in this grim world are the former Watchmen — Rorschach (Jackie Earle
Haley), Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) and Dr.
Manhattan (Billy Crudup). They are living inconspicuously, helping the
government, prowling nighttime streets, watching their costumes gather dust.
They are all dissatisfied, with their own lives and with the society they
inhabit.

It’s a compelling setup, made all the more so by acute political and social
commentary. Paranoia about nuclear war, communist sympathies and military
supremacy are veiled swipes by the filmmakers at America’s current fears of a
nuclear Third World, terrorist networks and asymmetric warfare. Disturbed by the
human propensity for violence and destruction, Nite Owl asks a fellow hero, The
Comedian, “What happened to the American dream?” The chilling reply: “It came
true.”

But somewhere between the dirty streets of Manhattan and the barren surface of
Mars, _Watchmen_ loses its way. After smaller stories of pedophiliac murderers
in New York and war criminals in Hanoi, suddenly the Watchmen are fighting in a
faux pyramid in Antarctica to save the world from doom. It’s the curse of the
blockbuster that pyrotechnics too often take priority over plot. The film’s
pessimism ends up feeling pedestrian. Any group of caped crusaders can save the
world. Yawn.

The more interesting questions are whether the world is worth saving, and from
whom. Writers David Hayter and Alex Tse force us into philosophical
difficulties, but then provide too-easy answers. In _Watchmen_, the threat to
humanity is human antagonism; the threat to America is American aggression.
These are not problems solved by a knockout punch, no matter how beautifully
rendered.

The film is also overly long, at 163 minutes. Anticlimactic, moralizing speeches
don’t make it feel any shorter. Director Jack Snyder and editor William Hoy
should have shaved a half hour from the running time, leaving Mars and
Antarctica on the cutting room floor. As _Watchmen_ keeps reminding us, the
world we’ve created is cold and unforgiving enough.
