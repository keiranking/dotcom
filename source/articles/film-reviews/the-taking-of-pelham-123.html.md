The Hollywood studio system, humming along with surprising resilience since the
Great Depression, spat out 610 movies in 2008, the vast majority feature-length
fictional narratives with the same actors, writers, directors, electricians,
plotlines, special effects and special effects supervisors as the year before
and the year before that. That’s why it’s a *system* — because the same movies
are *systematically* being made over and over again.

Another six hundred American films will be released this year, and despite their
tragic similarities to last year’s crop, almost every single one is being
marketed, at great expense, as the newest, biggest, loudest, most exciting,
explosive, expletive-filled, multiply orgasmic experience of your life.

Surprise. They’re not. Here’s three reasons why *The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3*, on
the surface a fresh action adventure, is just something old made new again:

1\. It is a literal remake. Actually, it’s a remake of a remake of an adaptation
of a novel. Morton Freedgood wrote a 1973 paperback thriller, *The Taking of
Pelham One Two Three*, in which four criminals hijack a New York City subway car
for a million dollars. It was made into a movie the following year with Robert
Shaw as the British lead hijacker, Ryder, and Walter Matthau as a crusty Transit
Authority policeman who tries to catch him. Twenty-five years later, it was
remade as a television movie. And finally, here it is again, with John Travolta
as a more brutish, brutal Ryder, and Denzel Washington as the embattled subway
dispatcher on the other side of the radio.

2\. It retreads one of the most consistent, tiresome and propagandistic themes of
American movies — that the U.S of A. is the greatest country on earth. The head
office of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) is two blocks from
the White House, with good reason — friends stay close. Washington has always
lent Hollywood its weight abroad, because it understands that Denzel is a far
more insidious and effective colonizer than an Army division.

During World War II, the government actually commissioned films from top
Hollywood directors, like John Ford and Frank Capra. *Pelham*’s director, Tony
Scott, might as well be on the payroll, with films that routinely rhapsodize
about America’s strength and spirit. He directed *Top Gun* (1986) — enough said.
An early scene in *Crimson Tide* (1994) shows a Navy crew — handsome, spruced
and patriotic — standing in formation in the rain. It’s great — if it doesn’t
make you gag. *Deja Vu* (2006) was explicitly dedicated to the supposedly heroic
people of New Orleans. If surviving a major hurricane constitutes heroism, we
need about 2.8 million medals in a hurry.

*The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3* features sunset panoramas of the Manhattan skyline
and characters who spout post-9/11 drivel like, “Makes you realize what you’re
fighting for, doesn’t it?” We get it. You love your country.

3\. In addition to being directed by Tony Scott, it stars Denzel Washington. This
has happened three times before — in *Crimson Tide*, *Man on Fire* (2004) and
*Deja Vu* — although Denzel’s alter ego seems to shrink in stature each time. In
*Crimson Tide*, he was the strapping, brilliant second-in-command of a US Navy
nuclear submarine, with the power to annihilate half of Russia. *Man on Fire*
made him an ex-CIA bodyguard who singlehandedly took down a Mexican kidnapping
ring. He was a troubled and lonely ATF agent in *Deja Vu* — at least he still
had a gun. His subway dispatcher in *Pelham* is never in control — under
investigation by superiors, under demands by Ryder, he looks to others before
making a move.

It’s big, it’s loud and it’s explosive, but you might want to let *Pelham 1 2 3*
pass you by. There’ll be a new movie next week, right?
