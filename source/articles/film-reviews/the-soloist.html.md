*The Soloist* is mainstream American filmmaking at its ambitious best — where
oversized budgets meet oversized imaginations — and if it attempts to take on
too many sweeping issues or employ too many cinematic tropes, it still manages
to entertain, elucidate and edify. It is the story of four isolated men, each
with grander delusions than the last, but only two of whom appear onscreen.

First, there is the white *Los Angeles Times* reporter Steve Lopez (a real
journalist, but here played by Robert Downey Jr), author of a human interest
column called ‘Points West’. Lopez traffics in stories of seedy streets, of the
disenfranchised but not dispirited denizens of the city. In the film, he lives
alone but works alongside his amicable, attractive ex-wife (Catherine Keener) —
in other words, he’s frustrated. And in both fiction and reality, he meets a
homeless black cellist who changes his life.

The cellist is Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, portrayed without reserve (or eyebrows)
by Jamie Foxx. His Ayers stumbles along both sides of the divide between genius
and insanity, talking in a soft, rambling patter as his mouth tries to catch up
with his mind. In both art and life, Ayers dropped out of New York’s Julliard
School because of his schizophrenia. When Lopez spots him, he has a violin with
two strings and a running commentary about his favourite Romantic composer.

Ludwig van Beethoven, although not seen except in marble or plastic, provides
the aural topology for *The Soloist*. One scene revels in the concrete majesty
of the city, with sky-high shots of its snaking highways and
Spanish-architecture suburbs — majesty courtesy of a Beethoven symphony. There
are implicit parallels drawn between Ayers and his idol — both suffering from
tragic conditions (Beethoven slowly went deaf) that obstructed the pure
expression of their immense talents.

Ayers is only at peace when consuming music, brilliantly conveyed halfway
through *The Soloist* when he sits in on a rehearsal for the Los Angeles
Philharmonic orchestra. As a hundred musicians dive into the first movement of
Beethoven’s Symphony No. 3, the screen explodes into a synesthetic sequence of
light and colour.

The uninitiated might wonder how an iTunes visualization found its way into the
film, but the bravura sequence distills cinema to its essence — the spatial
arrangement of light through time. Moreover, it proudly appends itself to a long
history of visual sound films — from Walter Ruttmann’s *Lichtspiel, Opus I*
(1921) and Oskar Fischinger’s *Allegretto* (1936) to the mid-century
experimentations of Peter Kubelka’s *Arnulf Rainer* (1960) and John Whitney’s
*Catalog* (1961). Like all maestros, these cine-magicians knew the exhilarating
potential of their medium — its ability to stimulate the eyes and soothe the
heart.

The man behind *The Soloist* is director Joe Wright, the most ambitious of all.
Within the scripted confines of one film, he provides a loving tribute to a
city, a scathing exposé of societal apathy and bourgeois pretensions, a filmic
concerto for a two-hundred-year-old musician, and a bond between two men who are
able to save each other from the ravages of life. Such an outsized endeavour, in
any art form — be it the words of Steve Lopez, the notes of Nathaniel Ayers, or
the images of Joe Wright — demands your admiration, your attention and the price
of admission.
