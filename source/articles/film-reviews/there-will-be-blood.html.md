In Paul Thomas Anderson's _There Will Be Blood_, Daniel Plainview is a Southern
oilman whose insatiable greed and unyielding disdain for his peers leave him
wealthy beyond his dreams and alone with his demons. His journey is set in the
dirty, barren plains of New Mexico at the turn of the last century, when there
was money to be made for the reckless and the adventurous. Plainview is both.
The film is a meditation on the allure of success, the twisted ethics required
to attain it and the moral poverty required to keep it, delivered through a
complex character study.

The film opens with Daniel (played with Method-rich relish by Daniel Day-Lewis)
toiling with a pick in a hole. He finds a small deposit of silver ore, and in
the effort to remove it, falls and breaks his ankle. He then drags himself
across the desert, with a sample tucked under his vest, back to the prospector's
office. This superhuman determination is both Daniel's greatest strength and
weakness. He swindles a farming family out of their oil-soaked land and is
tormented for the remainder of the film by the family's son, Eli Sunday, (Paul
Dano of _Little Miss Sunshine_ fame) and the fiery flavor of Christianity he
represents. Oil and religion fight for supremacy throughout the film's plodding
two hours and 38 minutes.

Day-Lewis delivers a performance full of tics — his tongue massaging his ruddy
cheeks, the veins in his forehead pulsing — but it comes off as angling too hard
for a Best Actor nod (which he got). A few more failed epics and Day-Lewis could
find himself in the discount bin of overextended Great Thespians with Jack
Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro: once great, now grating. Dano
finds the fun in his fundamentalist Eli, and although his menace falls flat, he
and Day-Lewis share a terrific baptism scene halfway through the film. Rounding
out the competent cast are Dillon Freasier as 7-year-old HW Plainview and Sydney
McAllister as his best friend, young Mary Sunday.

Jonny Greenwood provides dissonant strings on the soundtrack with mixed results.
At times, the bass and cello combination hints at Daniel's dark, tormented
loneliness, but elsewhere it feels out of place. Anderson's script (he wrote and
directed) could have used more of what the industry gently calls _polish_, but
amounts to the studio getting another scribe to toss out the bad parts. Subplots
appear for the sake of getting the audience through the second act, and Daniel's
deterioration into a paranoid hermit is neither adequately explained nor
explored. One wonders if the good people at Miramax picked up the project
because of its eerie parallels to America's current foreign fixation on oil and
the domestic disturbance of fundamentalist Christianity.

All told, _There Will Be Blood_ feels like one of Daniel's oil derricks: lots of
potential under the surface, but ultimately a great, big, sloppy mess.
