Once upon a time, in a Kingdom far, far away, across a mighty ocean, there lived
a woman whom everyone called Jo.

One day, Jo was taking the train from Manchester to London when an idea — a big,
glorious, billion-dollar, global franchise idea — popped into her head. It was
the story of a orphaned boy wizard. Jo wrote the idea down, and when she got
home, she kept writing. She wrote for the next five years, stopping only to move
to Portugal, get married, and have a child. She named the girl Jessica, and the
boy wizard Harry Potter.

To Jo’s surprise, children all over the world liked _Harry Potter_. So she wrote
more books. Children even found their parents reading _Harry Potter_, too. Jo
sold so many books, she became richer than the Queen of the Kingdom.

Far to the west, the nobles of another state heard about _Harry Potter_ and Jo’s
money. Being nobles, they wanted some of the money for themselves. So they flew
Jo over and asked her if they could leverage her original properties across
multiple platforms, finding synergies between their media conglomerate and
transnational corporations for merchandising tie-ins, yada, yada, yada. J K
Rowling said yes, and the nobles jumped with joy, giggled with greed and lived
happily ever after.

The five _Harry Potter_ movies (with three more to come) have amassed about US$5
billion, making it one of the most lucrative film franchises ever. That kind of
cash inspires the sincerest form of flattery. Thus was adapted J R R Tolkien’s
Middle Earth trilogy, _The Lord of the Rings_, which harvested another billion.
And C S Lewis’s classic children’s series _The Chronicles of Narnia_, whose
third installment is now about to begin filming. And Daniel Handler’s _A Series
of Unfortunate Events_. And now, Cornelia Funke’s _Inkworld_ trilogy comes to
the silver screen, starting with _Inkheart_.

Funke’s three fantasy novels — _Inkheart_, _Inkspell_ and _Inkdeath_ — and soon,
their film counterparts, suffer from being in the right place at the wrong time.
Which is to say, these perfectly enjoyable stories, originally written in
German, have the bad luck to be turned into films at the tail end of a decade
stuffed with adaptations of children’s fantasy literature. _Inkheart_, the film,
while not boring, feels old before it’s begun.

Our protagonist is a young girl, Meggie (like Ofelia from Guillermo del Toro’s
exquisite 2006 fantasy film _Pan’s Labyrinth_) who loves to read (like Ofelia
and also Harry Potter) and has lost a parent (like Ofelia, Harry Potter and
Frodo Baggins of _The Lord of the Rings_). An everyday object — a book —
transports her to a fantastical new world (like Ofelia (an insect), Harry (a
letter), Frodo (a ring) and the Pevensie children in _The Chronicles of Narnia_
(a wardrobe)!). In the name of all that is tragic and magic, how many
European-dwelling young bookworm orphans is too many?

The central conceit of _Inkheart_ is the permeability of the printed page —
losing yourself in a good book, in Funke’s world, can be a permanent
displacement. But _Inkheart_’s imaginary world is not rendered imaginatively —
both the CGI (computer-generated imagery) cloud that is the villainous Shadow
and the wooden clunk that is Brendan Fraser feel like outtakes from _The Mummy_.

As Meggie’s aunt says, “I prefer a story that has the good sense to stay on the
page, where it belongs.” The film’s producers should have taken that line of ink
to heart.
