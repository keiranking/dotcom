_Terminator Salvation_, like the war in which its characters are caught, had
many ways to go wrong. It is the fourth iteration of the action franchise, by
itself a bad omen (see _Jaws IV: The Revenge_, _Star Wars: The Phantom Menace_,
_Live Free or Die Hard_ et al).

The 1984 original, _The Terminator_, and its 1991 sequel, _Terminator 2:
Judgment Day_, both became instant classics, not least because of their
innovative director, James Cameron (who would later helm _Titanic_). Sequels to
sequels cannot budget for innovation, however, so cheaper talent gets subbed in
(e.g., Joe Johnston for Steven Spielberg in _Jurassic Park III_). McG, a man
best known for obnoxious music videos and noxious _Charlie’s Angels_ movies,
directs _Terminator Salvation_.

Better men than McG have been crushed under the canonical weight of their
franchises, done in by expectations or a desire to leave their mark. Joel
Schumacher killed _Batman & Robin_ after taking over from edgy A-lister Tim
Burton (_Batman_, _Batman Returns_); Sylvester Stallone self-destructed _Rocky
IV_. And the recently cancelled TV spinoff _The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ exposes
Warner Bros. as a negligent caretaker (unlike Sarah Connor herself).

The series also leaned heavily on Arnold Schwarzenegger’s beefcake bad-guy
(_Terminator_), turned good-guy (_Judgment Day_), turned both (_Rise of the
Machines_). Now that the Austrian is too old to play an ageless robot (or, as an
American politician, has become one), Christian Bale provides the testosterone
as resistance leader John Connor. This makes Bale the face of two concurrent
blockbuster series, _Terminator_ and _Batman_, as well as Michael Mann’s
upcoming gangster flick _Public Enemies_, risking overexposure.

But _Terminator Salvation_ doesn’t go wrong — it shows respect towards its
predecessors without being sycophantic, it rejuvenates the series for a
generation that considers the muscled Arnold a punchline, and it’s a good story
to boot.

John Connor has become that which the earlier films tried to prevent: _de facto_
leader of a _de facto_ resistance (because most of humanity has been killed).
The genocidal enemy is Skynet (a kind of evil, self-aware Internet), whose
unstoppable land, air and sea machines are mopping up the last bands of
survivors.

In the first film, a member of the resistance, Kyle Reese, is sent back in time
(to 1984) to protect Sarah Connor, future mother of John. They fall in love and
Kyle unwittingly becomes John’s father. In _Salvation_’s 2018, the adult John
must now find and protect a teenaged Kyle, yet to be sent back in time, and who
doesn’t know that John, his idol, is his son.

The subverted father-son dynamic forms the core of the film — as they both search
for each other—around which many digital action sequences are built. Those
sequences, and the film’s overall aesthetic, are heavily influenced by Alfonso
Cuarón’s 2006 dystopia _Children of Men_ (in turn influenced by the 1960s French
New Wave) — extended single-shot takes and a desaturation process called bleach
bypass lend the footage a _cinéma vérité_ feel (although the effect is tempered
by all the killer robots).

So McG redeems himself. Christian Bale, juggling franchises, tries to become
Harrison Ford. And for now, _Terminator_ lives on.

But their future is not set. Cue percussive bombast.
