_Hotel for Dogs_ is a perfectly functional movie about American orphan siblings
Andi and Bruce (Emma Roberts and Jake Austin) who rescue stray dogs from an
ignominious end at the pound. Familiar with the wrong side of the law, the pair
take refuge in an improbably-abandoned hotel which becomes home to the hounds.

The simple but strong parallels between the children and their canine companions
hold the film together. Suitably awful foster parents (Kevin Dillon of
_Entourage_ and Lisa Kudrow of _Friends_) and an awfully besuited social
worker/father figure (Don Cheadle) provide the moral poles. When we meet them,
Andi and Bruce bounce from one to the other, unable to find their place.
Managing the mutts, however, they make their own family, of a kind, and navigate
their problems by proxy.

Friendships are formed, lessons are learnt, obstacles are overcome. And there
are a lot of adorable dogs. What’s not to like? Our ratings board stamped it
with PG, which means it’s appropriate for your kids so long as you provide, in
the lingo, some parental guidance. But it seems highly inappropriate and even
irresponsible for Jamaican parents to take their young, impressionable children
to see a film that glorifies whiteness while marginalizing persons of colour.

We are a post-colonial island packed with shy of three million eating, sleeping,
breathing men and women, most of whom, if records existed, could trace their
ancestry to ancient, distinguished tribes of West Africa — the Twi, the Mende,
the Ashante, and so on.

Every day, our local media, including this newspaper, are filled with images and
stories about our black businessmen, our black doctors and diplomats, ministers
and magistrates, pastors and pilots. Our cultural footprint is out of all
proportion to our geography; travel anywhere, and the names Marley, Manley, and
McKinley will resonate.

You might say we are a great nation.

If you are puzzled and worried, therefore, by the sociological epidemic sweeping
across our land, where our women burn their hair straight and our men bleach
their skin light, look no further than _Hotel for Dogs_.

Emma Roberts, as heroine Andi, could be on the payroll for Gap, Dove and
L’Oréal; her complexion and coiffure are flawless. Inevitably, a preternaturally
handsome boy, Dave (Johnny Simmons), shows up to woo her. Conversely,
African-American co-star Kyla Pratt is given coveralls, pigtails, and an
overweight, overzealous suitor. Never mind she also has the hots for Dave; she’s
just there for emotional support. Don Cheadle, who imbues almost any dialogue
with dignity (_Ocean’s Thirteen_ notwithstanding), is here relegated to actual
child support. In one arbitrary scene, a plus-size black woman waddles onscreen
to provide comic relief.

This is not appropriate entertainment — not for adults, and certainly not for
our children, who have the persistent habit of growing into the adults of
tomorrow. As the credits roll for _Hotel for Dogs_, the producers are quick to
remind us that no animals were harmed. If you want to say the same for your
young loved ones, choose another movie. Its bite is a lot worse than its bark.
