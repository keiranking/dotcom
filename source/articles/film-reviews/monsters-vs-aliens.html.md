Susan Murphy has been hit with a big problem. After surviving a radioactive
meteor strike, she finds herself fifty feet tall, captured by the military,
living in a metal prison with bugs for friends, and tasked with defeating a
killer robot. Fortunately, she’s a big-picture kind of gal. Her real problem
comes when her fiance, an ambitious TV weatherman, tells her he doesn’t want to
live under her enormous shadow.

The audience is meant to side with Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), but the
studio behind _Monsters vs Aliens_ probably feels great empathy for the
self-involved reporter, Derek (Paul Rudd). After a decade spent making a dozen
computer-animated films, Dreamworks Animation should be pretty tired of playing
catch-up to the industry giant, Pixar.

Pixar is the Holy Reel — a film studio that consistently enjoys both critical
and commercial success. The movie executives love the returns; the children love
the characters; the critics love the sophistication. Critics are part of
Dreamworks’ problem — every time they spit out a movie, we can’t resist the
comparison.

But the studio invites the scrutiny by trying too hard to make Great Animated
Movies that instantly enter the contemporary canon, like Pixar’s _Toy Story_
(1995). Sometimes serendipitous timing or settings highlight their shortcomings,
pitting their _Antz_ against Pixar’s _A Bug’s Life_, or their forgettable _Shark
Tale_ against Pixar’s near-perfect _Finding Nemo_. And their most innovative
film to date, 2001’s fractured fairy tale _Shrek_, has been spoilt by soggy
sequels (with another, _Shrek Goes Fourth_, coming next year).

_Monsters vs Aliens_ feels like more of the same — Pixar already did big, hairy
creatures in _Monsters, Inc._ and provided the definitive animated action film
with _The Incredibles_. Susan Murphy, or Ginormica, as she becomes known, is no
Elastigirl. Admittedly, positive female protagonists are rare, and it is
exciting to watch her sort out her life while saving it. But it is hard to
embrace Susan for two reasons.

The first is her size, or more accurately, her proportions. Society is quite
fond of supervising children, railing against the corrupting influence of
everything from Movado to marijuana. But we apparently have no problem telling
our little girls they should look like an anorexic 15-year-old all their lives.
Susan is simultaneously sexualized and childlike — a combination that should
cause nightmares for parents with girls.

The second is the fault of directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon. Like boys
in a sandbox, they are too anxious to destroy the city they had built (in this
case, San Francisco, California), forgetting that we need to care about Susan
along the way. _Monsters vs Aliens_ is the first animated film made natively in
3-D (though we in Jamaica won’t get to see it) and the technology distracts the
filmmakers. So we get mesmerizing shots of the Golden Gate Bridge collapsing
into the sea, but they wash over us without much of an impact.

It’s tempting to think that Dreamworks will get it right next time. But with
sequels to _Kung Fu Panda_, _Madagascar_ and a Shrek spinoff in the pipeline,
you’re better advised to wait a few months for the next gift from the benevolent
gods of Pixar — _Up_, about an old man, a young boy, and a lot of balloons.
