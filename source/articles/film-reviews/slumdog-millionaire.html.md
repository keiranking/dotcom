A film opened on Wednesday set in India, funded by British production companies,
revolving around the Indian version of a British television show, and filmed in
India by a British director with Indian actors speaking both Hindi and English.
Got that?

Last Sunday, it won the American Academy Award for Best Picture. It’s time to
play a game. This came about because: a) the Academy voters are sick and tired
of their own products; b) Neocolonialism is hot; c) The plight of the Indian
poor deserves meaningless accolades; d) _Slumdog Millionaire_ is a really great
film.

We’ll use our 50-50 lifeline to take away two of the incorrect answers — a) and
c). The Academy Awards isn’t meaningless (anything watched by millions can’t
be), but it’s pretty close. In 1927, studio heads created the Academy, which has
about 6,000 members, to disenfranchise industry workers. As the de facto company
union, its job was to prevent other unions from forming. The awards were
incidental. _Slumdog_’s Best Picture statuette reflects the opinion of a few
thousand American craftsmen and women — public relations officers, art
directors, and so on — who work in western Los Angeles County, California.

Do these SoCal stiffs have a fetish for analyzing Anglo-Indian relations, or do
they just love _Slumdog Millionaire_? Let’s ask the audience — the movie
audience, that is.

Jamal and his older brother Salim live in a Mumbai ghetto as young children do —
subverting every authority they can. In the film’s vibrant opening sequence,
they outrun and outwit the police, get dragged to school by their single mother,
and get beaten by their teacher. A brutal community attack, fueled by ethnic
hatred, leaves the boys orphaned and homeless. Shivering, soaked, broke and
broken, they meet another orphan, Latika, and try to survive with the creed of
their old literature book, _The Three Musketeers_ — all for one, and one for
all.

Director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting), cinematographer Anthony Mantle and editor
Chris Dickens unfold Jamal’s journey piece by kaleidoscopic piece, in
tightly-paced snippets of colour and colourful dialogue. Simon Beaufoy’s script
is briskly chaptered — Jamal’s appearance on India’s _Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire_, and his slow progress up an ever-larger mountain of rupees,
provides the structural room for flashbacks, flash forwards and moments of
surrealism.

We get three films in one — a rags to possible-riches suspense, a buddy comedy
with Jamal and Salim (played by three actors each, ending with Dev Patel and
Madhur Mittal in the adult roles), and an epic love story between Jamal and
Latika (again with three actors, last by Freida Pinto) as they try to overcome
betrayal, poverty, geography, doubt, and trauma.

Sleeping security guards, beggars at four-way intersections, young gunmen on
nighttime streets — these and other details collapse the distance between the
East and West Indies, between Navi Mumbai and New Kingston. A don frustrated
with the cricket match on TV. A police force acting as judge, jury and
executioner. No wonder the audience at Carib clapped, cheered and cried.

In the end, it doesn’t matter which answer is right, or what the authorities
say. _Slumdog Millionaire_ tells us — wonderfully, wordlessly, and winningly —
the only thing that matters is whether you give up. Keep playing, no matter the
odds, no matter the past, no matter the cost, no matter the pain. All for one.
One for all.
