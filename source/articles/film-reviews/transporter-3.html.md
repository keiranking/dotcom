Like its two predecessors, _Transporter 3_ stars Jason Statham as
driver-for-hire Frank Martin as he couriers a dangerous package while kicking
ass, getting undressed, and kicking ass while getting undressed. If you are a
fan of the previous films, or of action thrillers in the era of Bourne, or of
Statham’s impossibly chiseled body, then you’ll like _Transporter 3_.

This time, Martin is transporting a damsel-in-minidress, Valentina (Natalya
Rudakova), from Marseille, France to Odesa, Ukraine in an Audi A8 W-12. The
distance between the two is more than 2000km as the crow flies, or roughly ten
times the length of Jamaica. So you’ll also like this movie if you’re a fan of
long legs, fast cars or impossibly short drives across the Mediterranean.

Director Olivier Megaton keeps things tripping along: along with editors Camille
Delamarre and Carlo Rizzo, Megaton captures twice the kinetic energy of Bourne
director Paul Greengrass, but with half the coherence. Greengrass always
understood the action was in service of the story; Megaton has it the other way
round, glossing over dialogue to get to the next hyperactive chase.

The _Transporter_ films always emphasize karate chops over acting chops, so
Statham’s performance, dynamic in its physicality, is emotionally static. (It
doesn’t help that composer Alexandre Azaria mickey-mouses the entire score;
nothing drains a scene like overblown music.)

By now, it’s difficult to watch Statham’s topless roundhouse kicks, grimaces at
the wheel, or manic sprint without thinking you’ve seen it all before. His
career, full of promise after his terrific debut a decade ago in Guy Ritchie’s
Brit-indie heist flick _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_, has jumped the
shark with one too many jumper-cable, ready-for-cable movies.

Aside from the _Transporter_ trilogy, you can find Statham doing his
muscleman-of-action shtick in _The One_ (2001), _The Italian Job_ (2003),
_Chaos_ (2005), _Crank_ (2006) and its upcoming sequel _Crank 2_, and _Death
Race_ (2008). Want definitive proof? Last Sunday, he appeared in a high-octane
Audi ad during America’s NFL Super Bowl, his entire persona boiled down to
thirty seconds of whip, kick, drive a stick.

Even if your appetite for Statham hasn’t been sated (and let’s be honest, with
abs like his, it hasn’t), the misogyny laced through _Transporter 3_ is much
less palatable. The excuse that the film is intended for guys is no excuse at
all; it only entrenches double standards that need no entrenching.

Rudakova spends all her on-screen time in make-up and heels, by turns helpless,
high and horny. And she is the only woman in the film, with no balance provided
for her cardboard character. Franchise writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen
clearly think, or are comfortable creating the illusion, that the world is a
brutal but ultimately simple place where men manage, manipulate and mutilate
each other, with beautiful women tagging along for the ride.

For _Transporter 3_, like a sports car, a shopping spree, or any guilty
pleasure, one rule endures: after you’ve paid your money and had your fun, call
your friend and confess you’ve done a bad thing.
