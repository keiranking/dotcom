This is how it usually works in America — little movies have big ideas, and big
movies have little ideas. For little movies with big ideas, think Steven
Soderbergh’s *sex, lies and videotape* (1989) or Darren Aronofsky’s *Requiem for
a Dream* (2000) or Christopher Nolan’s *Memento* (2000), respectively tackling
voyeurism, addiction and memory. For big movies with little ideas, consider
Steven Soderbergh’s *Ocean’s Twelve* (2002) or Darren Aronofsky’s *The Fountain*
(2006) or Christopher Nolan’s *Batman Begins* (2005).

Little movies with big ideas are easy to love, and big movies with little ideas
easy to hate. High art, low art. Simple. So when a big movie tackles big ideas,
as in *The Matrix* (1999), *Wall-E* (2008) and now *Surrogates*, it’s a little
disorienting.

Feeling disoriented is intrinsic to *Surrogates*, which extrapolates advances in
prosthetic limbs, along with our current penchant for creating virtual selves,
to a time when everyone navigates the world via humanoid-robot versions of
themselves. Just like the Internet, everyone makes their alter ego more
attractive than in reality. Living vicariously through their beautiful
surrogates, people experience the upside of life — like sexual promiscuity —
without the nasty downside — like viral diseases. Fail-safe mechanisms prevent
extreme pain — running into a bus, for example — from transmitting to the
operator.

The real upshot of surrogacy, however, is that societal evils and violent crimes
have all but disappeared (since all the real people are ensconced at home). No
racism, no sexism, no murder. Bruce Willis plays Tom Greer, an FBI agent without
much to do until he grabs a rare homicide. His investigation provides the
narrative arc for *Surrogates*; the emotional arc stems from his ambivalence
towards the technology.

The big idea being tossed around (while Greer gets tossed around) reflects that
ambivalence. One of the central tenets of post-industrial societies, and the
driving force behind much of the global economy, is that newer, better
technology inches us towards a more perfect world. Apple unveiled newer, better
iPods in September, as they did last September, as they will next September.
Email, then instant messaging, then texting, and now Facebook provides newer,
better ways to connect with anyone you’ve ever known. Your computer, if you’re
reading this on one, is already obsolete.

All of which is supposed to be unequivocal good news, allowing us to do more
while doing less, and work smarter, and other productivity clichés. You probably
have an iPod, and a Facebook account, and a computer. *Surrogates* asks, at what
cost? In the film, the cost is clear — without actual contact, people have
forgotten, or lost, an essential part of their humanity.

One of the cleverer aspects of *Surrogates* is how it visually represents that
loss by flipping a Hollywood convention. From its opening frames, the film is
filled with extraordinarily fit, beautiful people, the kind of anatomical
exceptions American movies are known for. Except in *Surrogates*, they’re
everywhere, a relentless inundation of plucked eyebrows, chiseled chins and
tucked tummies. You’re so sick of seeing perfect breasts that whenever someone
unplugs their surrogate and stands up, their imperfections, their sheer
ordinariness — mussed hair, dimpled skin, fatigued faces — becomes stunning.

Of course, plot holes abound, the heroes are white, and things work out in the
end. But for a highly imperfect, ordinary big movie, *Surrogates* is a little,
well, appealing.
