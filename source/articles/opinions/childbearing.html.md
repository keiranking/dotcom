Valentine’s Day is here.  That means no matter how your Friday begins, if you
have a partner, you know how it's going to end.

There’s nothing wrong with fooling around.  Armed with condoms, diaphragm,
aspirin, Plan B, coconut oil, iTunes, blood tests, two passport pictures and a
therapist, it can be downright enjoyable.  But performed as nature intended, sex
is the ultimate biological credit card—you splurge for seven minutes, pay
nothing for nine months, and then get hit with the mother of all fees for the
next 20 years.

Those of you in calcified relationships, or conversely in the throes of
infatuation, feel free to tune out.   This is really for the pudgy middle of the
Bell curve—you know, regular people.  You’re not in the shape, job or house you
want.  You’re drifting and mildly depressed.  You’d be in an early midlife
crisis, if you only acknowledged it was the early middle of your life.  And in
the pit of your stomach, you know you have to do something about it, soon.

Don’t have children.

On the adorable face of it, a kid seems like the perfect solution.  Instead of
putting in the hard work of becoming unique or facing the bleak reality of dead
dreams, just use Mother Nature’s Instant Life Purpose (recipe: one egg, one
teaspoon semen, bake hot).  In a few strokes, you'll banish those pesky
existential questions forever, since everyone assumes parents are doing the best
they can, under the circumcisions.  Sorry, circumstances.

Except for one detail—it doesn’t work.  In the most comprehensive study on the
subject, [just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences][1], tabulating an astonishing one million people around the world over
six years, researchers from Princeton and Stony Brook University confirmed that
having kids doesn’t make you happier.  In fact, in the Caribbean, regardless of
age, “those with children… have lower life evaluation”, experiencing the same
happiness and enjoyment as the childless, but higher levels of “worry, stress
and anger”.  Yet roughly three in four of us, they found, keep spitting them
out.

[Opposition senator Ruel Reid wants to limit us by law to two children each][2],
akin to China—disturbingly draconian, comically unenforceable and ultimately
unnecessary.  Because there aren’t any solid reasons to procreate, and haven’t
been since the Bronze Age, when we took extinction pretty much off the table.

Yes, the clock is ticking.  Precious, irretrievable time is slipping away not
just for childbearing, but everything on your bucket list.  Learning Spanish.
Living in New York.  Walking the Great Wall.  Having a threesome.  Playing the
piano.  Buying that Audi.  You’re way behind, and at current costs, that rugrat
will set you back a further J$17,000,000 by the time it graduates high school.
You’re not Michelle Obama; you can’t have it all.  Choose.

No, it won’t save your relationship.  You’ll get a grace period of hot pregnancy
sex, and a few years of shared wonder at having created a hairless pygmy.  Look,
it gurgles when we feed and poke it!  It must love us!  But it’s a phallic
fallacy.  After the novelty and upholstery have worn, you’ll still be the same
two incompatible people, only with less energy, time and patience than before.
And adding an underage referee to your fights is a criminally bad move.

Yes, your parents want to be grandparents, and your four-bedroom friends look
fulfilled.  It’s a trap.  Existing parents are like the living dead in zombie
movies—already bitten, they try to swell their ranks, sending you everything
from brightly-coloured novelty vibrators on your anniversary to their own
deranged offspring on the weekends.  Don’t fall for it.  They’re trying to feel
better about buying bigger clothes for themselves along with the children.  Stay
in shape and become their favourite aunt and uncle.  You’ll get 80% of the
affection for 20% of the affliction.

If you still decide to extinguish your dreams, torpedo your marriage, and forgo
being sophisticated, there is a last resort.  Wait a few years and call me to
babysit.  I love other people’s kids.  They’re immature, unvarnished and
addicted to Lego.  We’ll get along great.
