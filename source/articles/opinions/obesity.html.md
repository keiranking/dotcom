It’s crunch time. [One in three adults worldwide is overweight][1], a pandemic
of 2 billion people courting diabetes, stroke, pneumonia, heart disease and
cancer. That’s [our top five killers][2] lined up like the Grim Reaper’s firing
squad, with the entire species waddling to execution. The Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation, based in Seattle, [weighed 188 countries between 1980
and 2013][3] — not a single nation managed to slim down. Jamaica looks destined
for the flabby bottom of the chart — although we’re not as meaty as America,
[we’re bulging four times as quickly][4]. The Ministry of Health now says an
astonishing [40% of our men][5] and [80% of our women][6] are too fat.

That last sentence might rankle some readers. _Too fat? Who the hell appointed
you Big Bad Wolf to huff and puff about our weight?_ Relax. This isn’t another
diatribe telling anyone to eat more fruits and grains. (Although we all should,
they’re delicious.) In fact, you don’t have to listen to me, your spouse, or
even your doctor, so long as you heed the writing on the hospital wall. The
body-mass index (BMI) is a color-coded range of safe weights for every height,
based in part on the stress limits of our bones and joints. Tip into the yellow,
and you’re overweight. Go orange, and you’re obese. Simple, no?

Not really, because being heavy comes with extra baggage — the kind that doesn’t
show up on the chart. Studies show that the plus-sized receive [less sympathy
from jurors][7] [and doctors][8], [less respect as doctors][9] and
professionals, and [less pay overall][10] than their svelte counterparts. Add in
a media preoccupied with six-packs and thigh gaps, not to mention euphemisms
like ‘extra baggage’, and you’ve got a perfect storm of discrimination,
poisoning [places that once had largesse for largeness][11] (Puerto Rico, Samoa,
Fiji) with fat bias.

All that prejudice can leave big folks feeling a little small, so a
counterculture has taken shape, promoting body acceptance — essentially, the
same “Hey, we’re people, too!” rallying cry of all oppressed groups. But like
the gay rights movement before it, body acceptance lives in the gray area
between genetics and lifestyle, which has left its advocates confused about what
to fight for.

At the genetics (or ‘nature’) end is a battle about body *type* — the idea that
deodorant commercials reinforce an unattainably young, flawless, Eurocentric
image of desirability. That’s true. Hence deodorant commercials, like Dove’s
long-running ‘[Real Beauty][12]’ campaign, now try to showcase a variety of
ethnicities, ages and hairdos. A necessary corrective, because as any seamstress
can tell you, even the fittest people come in a variety of shapes —
small-busted, wide-hipped, long-legged, and so on.

At the lifestyle (or ‘nurture’) end is a skirmish about body *size* — the idea
that everyone, regardless of their waistline, should be considered healthy and
beautiful. Hence the acronym HAES (Healthy At Every Size), defiant hashtags like
#fattitude and the international celebrity of [Tess Munster][13], the first
size-24 fashion model. This is dangerous psychological comfort food, convincing
people they’re somehow making the world better by eating cheeseburgers. Healthy
obesity is an oxymoron — those surplus pounds trim up to [a decade off your life
expectancy][14], even if you lose the weight in your attenuated old age.

Yes, beauty should be diverse, but it shouldn’t be meaningless. By definition,
we can’t all be equally attractive, unless the point of comparison is a manatee.
So let’s agree to ditch the Greek ideal, but replace it with Jamaican common
sense. Beauty and health should be synonyms, defined by our individual realities
instead of our collective delusions. It’s okay to be imperfect and miss the gym
and cheat the diet and splurge on your birthday and relapse and make mistakes
and fail — we’re all human — but it’s not okay to demand the rest of us call it
a victory.
