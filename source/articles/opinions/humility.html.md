Two weeks ago on Nationwide, discussing the accuracy of the Bible with poet
Mutabaruka, pastor Conrad Pitkin and journalist Ian Boyne, I said, “It’s not for
me to demonstrate that reality is reality. The onus is on whoever claims
something ridiculous to provide evidence that it is [real].” In the studio, I
winced—’ridiculous’ sounded dismissive, ‘fantastic’ would have been better.
Stupid. I’d left an opening for a sharp debater. Mr Boyne latched on right away
in his verbose style, calling for “epistemological humility” from all involved.

That’s a mouthful, so let’s digest it slowly. Epistemology is the study of
knowledge itself. It’s about what we know, and how we know what we know. For
instance, you can know from swatting tables that 12 x 8 = 96 without knowing how
to multiply. You can design bicycles without being able to ride one. You can use
an octopus to predict the winner of the World Cup and end up right for the wrong
reason. There are all sorts of limits and quirks to knowing, once you know where
to look.

Underneath the big words, Mr Boyne was calling me arrogant to dismiss Bible
miracles because, gee, you never know. Maybe God did beat us to artificial
insemination, and split the Red Sea before we split the atom. Maybe my
scientific worldview—my way of knowing things—is too limited to see the larger
truth about God. And that possibility, Mr Boyne posits, should humble us all.

Time to fess up. Mr Boyne was correct—I was a bit cocksure. But here’s the
really interesting question. Was my arrogance justified, or are all ways of
knowing equal?

When science goes up against religion, it sounds like a fair fight between
people in white coats and people in white robes. It's not. Science, from the
Latin root for (surprise!) 'knowledge', is basically asking a question, trying
to answer it, and then telling other people. Those people ask more questions,
and the process repeats, over and over and over, weeding out bad ideas from good
over time. That's all. Science, to be succinct, is thinking. It's
problem-solving. And it's taken us from the mud to the moon.

If you're religious, and you grapple with questions about where the world came
from, why you're here, or how to live well, congratulations, you're doing
science. You're thinking. Suggesting God is the answer to those questions is
still science. In the absence of more questions, it's worth a try like anything
else. Sticking your fingers in your ears so you don't hear those questions—known
as faith—is where it goes wrong.

Even the religious prefer the epistemology of science (knowing by thinking) to
that of faith (knowing by trust). If we gathered hundreds of Jamaican pastors to
discuss emigration, none of them would suggest asking God to open a land passage
between Mobay and Miami. Why not? Because everyone knows—from science—it won't
happen. If Reverend Pitkin seriously suggested splitting the Caribbean Sea, the
other pastors would think he was crazy.

He'd also be holding up progress, and that's the real issue. When we need a
solution, people who can't distinguish between the improbable and the impossible
are worse than useless—they stop the rest of us from moving forward. If an idea
can’t survive interrogation, it should perish. And anyone who wilfully ignores
the expiration date should be excluded from the conversation. When facing dogma,
humility becomes a liability that keeps inferior ideas on life support.

Say we’re building a highway. You want the route to go through Kellitts and I
want it to go around. Being humble helps us hear each other’s rationale. But if
your argument includes that Jesus agrees with you, at that point it's best for
me to bypass you and the town.

Excessive humility also threatens existing knowledge. The presence of evolution,
for example, is still hotly debated even though there’s nothing sensible left to
discuss. Tolerating ideas like intelligent design, after science disproves them,
makes it harder to push the boundary of our knowledge by turning it into a line
in the sand. In the end, the most arrogant position of all is refusing to admit
when you’re wrong.
