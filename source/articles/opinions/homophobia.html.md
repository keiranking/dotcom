A scourge has swept our great nation. A disgusting way of living has infiltrated
our homes and churches, perverting the minds of even our precious children. At
the heart of this wicked, sinful behaviour is a particular segment of
society—limp-wristed, fashion-conscious, high-voiced art lovers traipsing around
with shaved legs and armpits. They’re out in public, everywhere you look. You
know who I mean, right? Women.

The scourge I’m talking about is homophobia, the extreme fear of our gay friends
and family members that makes us commit acts of unspeakable cruelty. These acts,
though perpetrated by us men against other men, are ultimately about women.

What exactly is the problem? Simply that we are, [Time magazine chides][1], ‘the
most homophobic place on earth’, a country where our gay brothers and sons live
a shadowed life under constant threat of exposure and assault. Last year, Dwayne
Jones was [stabbed and shot to death][2] by a mob for cross-dressing and dancing
with a man. A UTech student was chased by his peers and [beaten by the security
guards][3] with whom he sought refuge. Dancehall music, the pulse of the nation,
is still laced with poisonous lyrics advocating violence against homosexuals.
How bad is it? Until recently, [more Jamaicans sought help][4] from [Immigration
Equality][5], an American asylum group for gays, than any other nationality.

Why do we have such a vicious collective reaction to harmless individual
behaviour? Because men are afraid of other men—straight men. ‘Homophobia’, says
[sociologist Michael Kimmel][6], ‘is the fear that other men will reveal to us
and the world that we are not as manly as we pretend.’

Imagine a perfect Adonis—tall, fit, rough and rugged, flush with cash and
virility, whisking nubile models between New Kingston and Norbrook in his
oversize pickup. Secure at the top of the masculinity pyramid, he watches the
rest of us jockey for position and female attention below. Some of us shield our
own insecure spot by dislodging others (“real men don’t cry, wuss”). The lower
down we are, the more desperate our infighting and need to climb becomes, and
the more naked our displays of machismo (motorcycles, dancing) to impress women.
Those of us at the bottom, emasculated by equally stinging prejudices of class
and colour, lash out at the best remaining target—gay men. In a place like
Jamaica, with so many dispossessed, that attack metastasizes into widespread
bigotry and deadly mob violence.

The solution, as for so much else, is education. Most Jamaicans (abetted by
Christian authorities with borderline malicious intent) remain ignorant of the
basic facts about sexual orientation. Well, here they are.

[Homosexuality isn't a choice][7]. Let me repeat that. Being gay is not a
choice, as [study][8] after [study][9] after [study][10] has documented,
examined, tested and proven. (If it was, who in their right mind would choose to
be gay in Jamaica?) What’s more, humans are only one of thousands of documented
[species that exhibit same-sex pairings][11], including cats, dogs, goats,
horses, monkeys, birds and in a wonderfully appropriate touch, [our own common
house lizards][12]. Somehow I doubt they’re picking a lifestyle.

Science hasn’t yet found specific genes responsible for homosexuality, but we do
know a lot else. Male sexuality is more fixed than female, [somewhat hereditary
and quite likely already in place at birth][13]. Women related to gay men tend
to be more fertile, which partially explains how homosexuality persists even
though gays usually don’t have children. And [a clever new study by
economists][14] suggests our current best guess, that roughly one in ten of us
are attracted to our own sex, may be underestimating the true number by as much
as half. Which means all of us—yes, even you—have gay or bisexual friends.

You’d think it unnecessary to say this to slave descendants, but discriminating
against people for something natural and unchangeable isn’t cool. The explosion
in activism and awareness in recent years is not an epidemic of homosexuality,
but rather a welcome step towards openness and equality for people who have
always been there, and always will be. My friends of every orientation defy
stereotype and are at times wonderful, vivacious luminaries and selfish,
capricious asses. But we’ll never see the full rainbow of gay humanity until we
take a straighter look at ourselves.
