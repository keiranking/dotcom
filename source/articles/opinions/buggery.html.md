Not so long ago, a group of concerned clergy published [‘A Call for Unity’][1],
an open letter urging their communities to obey existing Jim Crow laws.
Fortunately, the letter was smuggled into a Birmingham jail cell, where Dr
Martin Luther King penned [his famous response][2], since translated into 40
languages and transmitted around the world.

“There are two types of laws,” he wrote, “just and unjust. One has not only a
legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral
responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that ‘an
unjust law is no law at all.’ Now, what is the difference between the two? How
does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? Any law that uplifts human
personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.”

Those eight white Alabama preachers, despite their best intentions, found
themselves on the wrong side of history. They were not evil men. They were
honest men with honest families, trying to keep things the way they were, the
way they understood, the way they had been raised. But that meant tolerating
laws that degraded human beings, laws that would not — and could not — last.
Like the walls of Jericho, segregation statutes came tumbling down, taking us
all closer to a world where people are judged by the content of their character.

Now it is our turn.

You might not think we are living through a moment of similar impact, but
important moments do not arrive with [orchestral scores and Denzel
Washington][3]. They look ordinary until, like fireworks, they explode into
significance.

[Professor Brendan Bain’s firing][4] has ignited a wave of religious protests
that have literally and figuratively made their way from the gates of the
University of the West Indies to the heart of Half Way Tree. Last week, [an
anti-gay rally drew 25,000 supporters][5] and [incredulous international
coverage][6]. It was a call for unity, organized by honest clergymen, urging
their communities to uphold the existing anti-sodomy laws.

If it sounds dangerously familiar, it’s because it is. The prejudice of [the
Offences Against the Person Act][7] is nakedly clear: “Whosoever shall be
convicted of the _abominable_ crime of buggery…”, “any male person who, _in
public or private_, commits… any act of <i>gross indecency </i>with another male
person, shall be guilty…” If you’re somehow having trouble seeing the bias, try
substituting ‘female’ for ‘male’, or better yet, ‘genuine intimacy’ for ‘gross
indecency’.

Yes, sometimes bad things happen — men, women, and children are abused,
assaulted and raped. But we do not ban owning kitchen knives or picking kids up
from school or meeting a date on a Friday night. Even though [Amnesty
International documents a ‘very high… rate of sexual violence against women in
Jamaica’][8], there is no movement afoot to outlaw vaginal intercourse. Why not?
Because it would degrade our human personality to do so ([and it wouldn’t stop
us from copulating][9]).

As it is, we live in a highly repressed society, with both sexes squeezed into
narrow corridors of acceptable behaviour and appearance. If you have dark skin,
a belly, libido on Saturday and guilt on Sunday, you are the <i>sine qua non
</i>of Jamaica. But if you are of ambiguous descent, if you are bilingual or
bisexual, if you are an atheist or an activist, if you use words like _sine qua
non_, if your hair or clothes or gait or gestures or a hundred other social
signifiers do not meet the approval of the dominant Christian authorities, you
are implicitly stripped of your national membership and consigned to live in the
shadows.

This is discrimination, pure and simple, and it is not worthy of a people who so
recently escaped its wrath under a different name. We should be ashamed of
ourselves. We should be rallying not to defend but to dismantle our buggery
legislation, because it degrades the humanity of those it affects. If the long
arm of the law wants to reach into our bedrooms, it must grab hold of all of us
equally, regardless of sexual orientation. Anything else is unjust.

Rev Stevenson Samuels, chairman of the group of churches behind the Half Way
Tree rally, claims to be “[opposing injustice wherever it is, asking that the
nation rise up for truth and rights… and that our laws be based on these
premises][10].” Indeed, that is a worthy goal, and one shared by [the remarkable
black American preacher][11] who fought to secure a lasting dignity for his
fellow men. If we are to repeat history, let us do so in the measure of our
compassion rather than the longevity of our condemnation.
