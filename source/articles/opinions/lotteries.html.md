On Thursday, some lucky Jamaican won [the biggest Lotto jackpot ever][1] —
US$3.4 million. Someone else clinched [the US$1 million Super Lotto][2] last
week. Huzzah — if they’re good with money, these two _nouveau riche_ can buy
their dream houses, his-and-hers German cars, extended vacations at Couples, set
aside American-college tuition for all their children, and still have a tidy sum
for the retirement fund. Sadly, that fiscally-responsible utopia is unlikely to
emerge, because when they had far less, the winners were already wasting money
on lottery tickets.

It’s hard to see the folly through the blinding light of fortune, and you might
be itching to scratch your favourite numbers at the corner vendor, entranced by
the proximity of wealth. _Hey, those guys were struggling just like me, and now
they’re filthy rich! Maybe I’ll be next!_ Don’t do it. You’re a thousand times
more likely to be murdered by Christmas than hit the Lotto jackpot. [Playing the
lottery is a fool’s errand][3], and a fool and his money… well, you know the
rest.

There are two tricks that underpin all lottos. The first is mathematical — in a
game of random chance, it’s hard to know what will happen next, but easy to know
what will happen overall. Flip a coin, and you have no way to tell how it will
land. Flip a hundred coins, however, and it’s child’s play to intuit that
roughly half will be heads. In the same way, Supreme Ventures (SVL) doesn’t know
or care what happens in tomorrow’s Pick3 draw — they can predict almost exactly
how many players will win over the next ten years, which allows them to tilt
today’s prices and prizes in their favour.

The second trick is psychological, thanks to humans being born optimists.
Studies show that we badly overestimate our chances of success [in marriage][4],
[in sports][5], [in the workplace][6] — in short, in life. Why? British
neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that our brain is [physically better at
processing good news than bad news][7] about the future, an evolutionary
adaptation that keeps us smiling despite knowing we’ll die someday. When people
were asked to imagine their own tomorrows, she notes in her book [‘The Optimism
Bias’][8], “even the most banal life events [took] a dramatic turn for the
better.”

Betting-and-gaming companies use their rational calculations and our irrational
expectations to grow an orchard of poison apples — the slot machine, the
blackjack table, the horse racecard, and the unfairest of them all, the lottery
ticket — knowing that we can’t resist taking a bite, and then another, and then
another. For Supreme Ventures, that means gargantuan piles of money — [J$41
billion last year alone][9] — and [an ever-expanding gambling kingdom][10],
including the JustBet and Acropolis brands.

But why punish success? After all, we need robust, profitable local companies to
employ some of [the 420,000 Jamaicans out of work][11]. If we don’t blame Bigga
soft drinks for capitalizing on our weakness for sugar, why chastise Supreme
Ventures for exploiting our weakness for hope?

Because everyone indulges their sweet tooth, but it’s usually the poor who play
the lottery. The wealthy don’t need bouncing ping-pong balls, having already won
life’s sweepstakes through inheritance or ingenuity. And middle class families
are more likely to invest their earnings in the bank, the bungalow and the baby.
It’s low-income folks, without steady jobs, social mobility or statistics
degrees, who are especially susceptible to dream merchants. “Mi love Cash Pot.
It addictive like smoking,” says [Sheron Ellis, mother and Fletcher’s Land
resident][12]. “If mi win a money, we cook, and if mi gamble and lose, mi just
bear [the hunger].”

That’s a brutal set of choices to be enabling. If I walked through [Fletcher’s
Land][13] selling fake property deeds for $100, I could be rightly jailed for
taking advantage of lower-class illiteracy. Supreme Ventures runs the same
scheme at the same price, yet [its executives][14] [are routinely
venerated][15], despite exploiting the Jamaican people’s innumeracy.

The math couldn’t be simpler. In Cash Pot, the five-times-a-day colossus which
accounts for two-thirds of SVL’s revenue ([J$26 billion in 2014][16]),
participants pick a number between 1 and 36. For a regular player to break even,
then, the company would have to back every $1 wagered with $36 of potential
reward (since you can’t win more than 1/36th of the time). Instead, they offer
[a loss-making $26 multiplier][17], literally banking on the ignorance of its
customers. When your business model boils down to conning people without great
CXC results, you’re at best unethical and at worst a criminal. [Supreme Ventures
is perfectly aware of this][18], which is why they promote [their token
contributions][19] to [sports, health and education programmes][20] so heavily,
hoping a spritz of disinfectant will cover the rotten stench.

The truth is the lottery is a nasty business, the kind of enterprise that
thrives in dark-paneled boardrooms, away from public scrutiny, where commerce
can trump compassion. Supreme Ventures co-founders [Paul Hoo][21] (company
holdings worth US$7 million) and [Ian Levy][22] (US$10 million) owe [their
eye-watering wealth][23] partly to their old Campion College and Jamaica College
degrees, but more so their willingness to levy a tax on the innumerate and
repackage it, Janus-faced, as a ticket to their dreams. But if you’re good with
money, there’s only one way to really win big — buy stock in Supreme Ventures
instead.
