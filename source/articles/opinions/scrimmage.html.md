Cancel the flights and contracts. Bulldoze the stadiums, strip the uniforms and
send home the players. Take away absolutely everything that makes the sport the
sport, and there would still be football in Sao Paulo tomorrow. It might be a
married couple, kicking an empty bottle down the street. Or a ragtag bunch of
boys, barefoot and sweaty, bruising each other with a tennis ball. Or a group of
older women, toned and tanned, playing keep-up on the beach. Eventually, the
familiar game would emerge, born anew out of reflex and restlessness.

It’s not just Brazil; it’s why football is so widely popular — at minimum, all
you need is something to kick and someone to kick back. In Jamaica, there’s no
maximum — a scrimmage game can swell from two to ten to twenty to upwards of
thirty men, lost in swirls of dust, the ball somewhere in the congested
epicentre of insults, injuries and inflated egos.

The World Cup has those, too, but it has something else — the best players on
the planet. Wayne Rooney, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and dozens of
other football phenoms are stretching their legs, waiting to razzle-dazzle the
largest captive audience ever assembled. [Almost 200 million people][1] will be
watching each match, and for viewers, the bloodlust, nationalism and awe fuse
into a powerful televisual drug. Walk into a bank or bar with a TV and witness
its power — all necks craned and eyes fixed in the same upward direction.

With so many fans soaking up *o jogo bonito*, you’d think scrimmage would
improve. Nope. Run onto the neighbourhood green this month at your own peril, as
your friends try out the soaring passes, laser-guided one-twos and fancy
footwork they see onscreen. Needless to say, the [*Estádio do Maracanã*][2]
could fit between the ambition and the ability of most weekend warriors,
resulting in games where you spend as much time retrieving the ball as receiving
it.

But even if Andrés Iniesta showed up underneath the guango tree with water
bottle and car keys in hand, he would have to adapt to the constraints of
Jamaican scrimmage. Most fields are slanted, uneven, only partially grassed and
dotted with a cornucopia of obstacles — gravel, pavement, flower beds, tree
roots, water pipes, light poles and cow droppings. The goalposts are stones, set
two paces apart and permanently bridged by the slowest, largest or oldest player
on the team. There is no referee, no box, no centre spot, no corners and no
lines — the field of play is delimited by nearby buildings and the stamina of
the participants.

A game under these conditions bears only a vague resemblance to the one beamed
via satellite. Every arena in Brazil has seven interlinked high-definition
cameras trained on each goal, giving the officials millimeter-precision with
their calls. At home, you could roll a ball directly towards the goal from ten
feet out and watch it curl away like an errant putt.

Still, the World Cup can guide you to victory in your local fixture, if you know
where to look. Watch the 32 teams in the opening round-robins, and you’ll see
the same pattern again and again — four guys at the back, four or five more in
the middle, and one or two up front. The strikers don’t run back to the keeper,
and the defenders rarely run forward to the half-line. If the opponents start to
threaten, they are swarmed by the midfielders.

That simple strategy would be unbeatable in scrimmage, where every game is lost
by an overcommitted attack. Too eager to score, players run upfield and hang
around, hoping for a fortuitous mistake. No one wants to be far from the action,
so more people pile forward, and the game becomes an oscillating series of mad
dashes to protect wide-open goals. It’s how early association football was
played, too, and as Jonathan Wilson shows in [_Inverting the Pyramid_][3], the
whole history of the sport has been a slow accretion of players into defense,
like a pane of glass thickening at the bottom.

Stars like Mesut Ozil and Luis Suarez may be tempting to imitate, but their
dexterity depends on their less-flashy compatriots being in position. What might
seem like an individual achievement is actually a team effort in disguise. So
this weekend, as your friends don the jerseys of their heroes and take the
field, try stealing the uncommon strategy of every World Cup champion — playing
sensible football.
