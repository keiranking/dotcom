From the way we carried on, you’d have thought it was [Tessanne Chin][1] inside
the blue-and-white Boeing. President Obama’s two-day visit in April, for him an
expediency, was for us a brush with divinity. Reflecting the mood, this
newspaper became a cover-to-cover paean to the quiet American, with rhapsodies
from correspondents and columnists, academics and ambassadors. Devon Dick wanted
us to [rename a highway][2]. The state-run JIS released a YouTube video titled
‘[Barack on the Rock][3]’, as if we were hosting the lead vocalist from a boy
band instead of a man with nuclear launch codes.

Our hero-worship springs from Mr Obama’s mixed-race ascendancy to the Oval
Office and his picture-perfect family life — smart wife, solid marriage, sweet
daughters. His unlikely achievements, along with his good looks, make him an
easy role model for a former slave colony with [one in two absentee fathers][4].
But the danger of adulation, as in all religions, is not the light on the pulpit
but the shadow behind the altar.

Nobel Peace Prize notwithstanding, Mr Obama commands the most active military in
the world, who makes sure that what America wants, America damn well gets. A
‘working visit’ from the US president is like a friendly visit from your boss —
only one of you gets to relax. And like an Arnett Gardens helper hosting her
Cherry Gardens employer, it happens infrequently (once every 30 years) and
requires new curtains (hence the re-paved streets and displaced street vendors).

Seems wasteful, but we misstep at our peril. Mr Obama’s foreign policy
disregards the developing world, killing Pakistani, Afghani, Somali and Yemeni
citizens in the name of freedom. The London-based Bureau of Investigative
Journalism estimates 50 people were [killed by US aerial strikes][5] in May,
with a total ticking towards 5,000. That number may not impress, originating a
hemisphere away, where we think terrorists proliferate. But many of the people
being killed aren’t soldiers, they’re civilians like us — farmers, teachers,
women, children.

How similar are the victims to Jamaicans? Momina Bibi, a 67-year-old midwife,
was picking okra from her garden when [an American drone strike scorched her
from the earth][6] in 2013. Only some of her nine grandchildren were injured by
shrapnel, but all of them have been scarred for life. "I no longer love blue
skies,” said [Zubair, 13][7]. “In fact, I now prefer grey skies. The drones do
not fly when the skies are grey."

Yes, the United States has created a world where brown-skinned children worry
[the sky will fall on their heads][8]. And if you think, hey, the leader of the
free world is a busy guy, he might not have heard this story, think again —
Zubair was testifying before the US Congress. There has been no apology. Through
thousands of deaths, the commander-in-chief has maintained a culpable silence,
broken only when an Italian and American were targeted, which prompted his
“[profound regret][9]”.

This double-standard isn’t a failing of Mr Obama per se; it’s a prerequisite for
the presidency. Americans believe, as they tell us _ad nauseam_, that they’re
“the greatest country on earth”. Naturally, [their leaders share that
exceptionalism][10]. They can’t elect someone who considers Jamaicans as equals
any more than we can elect someone [who thinks gays deserve the right to
marry][11]. Mr Obama’s drone warfare is no better or worse than George W Bush’s
torture prisons or Bill Clinton’s sanctions, which [UNICEF estimates killed
500,000 Iraqi children][12]. (For perspective, 3,000 Americans died on 9/11.)

Were these leaders from anywhere else, they’d probably appear in front of the
International Court of Justice. But no one wants to risk America’s wrath.
Symbolic gestures must suffice, as in Berlin last year, when the European Center
for Constitutional and Human Rights asked the German government to [charge Mr
Bush as a war criminal][13]. History has a weird sense of humour.

None of this is to suggest we should burn rather than hoist the American flag —
that would be equally silly. But until we behave with restraint, and then
self-respect, we shouldn’t expect it from others. Opening his UWI town hall, [Mr
Obama referenced Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser Pryce][14]. “There’s a lotta
people out there. And they’re the fastest,” he joked, all but leaning forward
and playing peek-a-boo. China produces [Olympic weightlifters][15] the way we
churn out sprinters, but none of the president's trips to Beijing have included
a shout-out to [Lü Xiaojun][16] or [Zhou Lulu][17] about how “they’re the
strongest.” Why? Because that’s how you talk to your middle child, not the
Middle Kingdom.

Being small and poor doesn’t have to mean being a doormat. Last year, economists
at Harvard and Dartmouth created [an easy metric of global influence][18]: for
each country, they simply divided their share of United Nations personnel by
their share of world population. Sweden, staffing 4% of the UN Secretariat with
0.2% of the world’s people, took the top spot, followed by Norway and Finland.
Guess who was No. 8, way ahead of the US? That’s right — Jamaica, with ten times
as much sway as our size would suggest. The good news is we’ve got a lot of time
to learn dignity from our diplomats — the next visit from an American president
won’t be until about 2045, via secure teleportation.
