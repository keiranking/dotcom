In the film ‘The Invention of Lying’, an old woman lies in a hospital bed,
terrified and clinging to life. Her son, seeing her fear, whispers through his
tears, “Mum, you’re wrong about what happens when you die. It’s not an eternity
of nothingness. You go to your favourite place in the whole world, and anyone
you’ve ever loved and who’s ever loved you will be there, and you’ll be young
again. There’s no pain. Just love and happiness. Say hello to Dad for me. Tell
him I love him.” And, with a smile on her wrinkled face, the old woman passes.

We’re desperate for our lives to mean something. We’re so desperate for meaning
we’re willing to graft it onto our bruised psyches. We’ll believe preposterous
claims without any evidence, if doing so transforms our random experiences — two
years of med school, a broken engagement and a toddler — into a tidy narrative.
[Two out of three Jamaicans][1] believe they’re being watched by the celestial
bouncer of the original Christmas party, and spend their lives trying to qualify
for an all-access pass. Despite [studies proving that prayer doesn’t work][2],
two million of us ask God for guidance. It turns out we never really outgrow
Santa Claus; we just pretend the untouched pile of milk and cookies isn’t there.

But why? Why do we perform such elaborate mental origami, imagining people we
cannot see and ignoring people we can? Because our fictions are more flattering
than the truth of our existence, and we’re a notoriously insecure species. We
start worrying as soon as we’re wheeled out of the nursery, and we don’t stop
until we’re wheeled into the nursing home. We worry about our weight and our
hair, and whether Sandra at the office has noticed we have too much of one and
too little of the other, and how long we should wait before answering her text,
and what we should say, and if she likes lobster, and why we bothered to ask her
out in the first place. Forget joy, anger, grief and lust — our defining emotion
is anxiety.

In fact, worrying is almost literally what makes us human. [Harvard psychologist
Daniel Gilbert][3] says we are ‘the only animal that thinks about the future’
(though new research reveals that [apes also make basic plans][4]). Our huge
frontal lobes are whizzing, whirring worrying machines, which is why mid-century
doctors [lobotomized][5] their neurotic patients — without the ability to
contemplate tomorrow, today is a rather pleasant place to be.

Our adult fairy tales — post-mortem paradises featuring an all-star lineup of
family and friends — are a transparent way to minimize our anxieties. Life is
complex, with each choice potentially a pebble that heralds a landslide.
Religious faith reduces all that to a binary decision: Does God approve? Alas,
this still leaves us in disarray. Does he prefer us to be bankers or
basket-weavers, live in New York or New Delhi, marry Lisa or Hannah? “We’re all
here for a reason” is the cocaine of enlightenment, an attempt to skip the
tedious, tortuous process of making mistakes and finding our way with a snort of
uncut determinism.

The truth is we are nothing more or less than rearranged stardust, a cosmic
hiccup, the arbitrary result of billions of years of evolution, with an assist
from a handful of meteors. We are weaker than the horse, slower than the dog,
more fragile than the cow and more fussy than the pig. Yet we domesticated them
all with our overinflated brains. We're here by chance but not fortune; what we
are is fixed, but what we become is not.

Yes, like other animals, we're shackled to the imperatives of nutrition, rest
and reproduction. But we're also smart enough to add our own items to the list,
and it’s insulting to our hard-won intelligence not to try. Surrender
superstition and think. What constitutes a life well-lived? Nelson Mandela
suggests the “difference we have made to the lives of others”, but there are
many valid answers — travel, wisdom, hedonism, charity. The key is you get to
decide, and for worrywarts like us, that's the most reassuring thought of all.
