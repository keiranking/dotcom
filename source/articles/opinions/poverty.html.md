It’s an embarrassing but inescapable truth about Jamaica—most of the time, we’re
a complete mess. From arresting criminals to developing industries, diversifying
exports to simplifying taxes, creating wealth to erasing intolerance, Jamaica
lags behind much of the world.

[Our GDP per capita][1] is less than half the global average. [According to the
Statistical Institute of Jamaica][2], almost one in three men and one in two
women in their early twenties can’t find work. Forty percent of [all the jobs in
the country ][3]are in farming, fishing and car repair. Construction and tourism
provide a quarter of the rest. And those hard-baked jobs pay about J$11,500 a
week, not enough to afford the computer to read this article.

What’s a beautiful banana-boat republic to do? Two hundred years ago, Jamaica
was the richest colony in the British Empire by a distance, and its citizens,
like [Simon Taylor][4] and [Thomas Thistlewood][5], the most wealthy. Falmouth
famously had running water before New York. How did we go from such prosperity
in 1814 to such poverty today? Why is Jamaica so poor?

It’s the billion-dollar question, one the best and brightest social scientists
have been chewing on for decades. Here’s the most influential living economist,
Robert Lucas: ‘Is there some action a government of India could take that would
lead the Indian economy to grow like Indonesia? If so, what, exactly? Once one
starts to think about [it], it is hard to think about anything else.’

It’s easy to know what makes a market healthy—just write down what the First
World does. Modern economists agree that balancing state budgets, suppressing
inflation, allowing free trade and investing in infrastructure is the way to go.
But what’s good for the country is not necessarily good for the government. In a
democracy, where politicians only last a few years at the top, it makes more
sense to spend as much as you can, protect the interests of powerful friends and
skimp on infrastructure apart from big, prestigious projects.

Still, with selfish people in power everywhere, why do rich countries stay rich
and poor countries stay poor? In 2001, a Turkish economist, Daron Acemoglu,
[solved an amazing, disturbing piece of the puzzle][6]. He discovered that he
could predict the current GDP of 70 countries, including Jamaica, by looking at
the mortality rate of white men in the 1800s. Wait, what? How in the name of
Paul Bogle are those two things even related?

It turns out that wherever European colonizers survived in large numbers, like
Australia and North America, they imported the rule of law from home. But where
they mostly succumbed to disease, like much of Africa and the West Indies, they
didn’t bother to set up strong institutions. Instead, they set a precedent of
grab-and-go, short-term, extractive policymaking that persists, like the viruses
they feared, to this very day. Out of many, one example—inefficient
bureaucracies that encourage and even tolerate widespread corruption.

[Tim Harford][7], yet another economist, explains ‘development is thwarted
because the rules and laws of the society do not encourage projects or
businesses which would be to the common good. The small amount of education and
technology and infrastructure [in a country like Jamaica] could be much better
used if the society was organized to reward good, productive ideas. But it is
not.’ By contrast, America’s patent system, effective courts and venture capital
paved the way, as much as the literal investment in highways, for a good idea
like FedEx to flourish. In turn, FedEx created the delivery network for Amazon,
whose supercomputers now enable Netflix, and the virtuous cycle continues.

This is all very depressing, because it suggests the problem of poverty operates
on a scale larger than anyone’s lifetime, that as a colonized people we were
predestined to struggle far past Independence, and that we are our own worst
enemy in implementing solutions. But depression is not despair. We have to find
a way to align the short-term interests of our elected officials with the
long-term interests of the economy. How to do that remains unanswered, but with
the world’s best and brightest on the job, it’ll probably only take another two
hundred years.
