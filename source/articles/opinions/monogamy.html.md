As an institution, marriage is on the rocks. People are [marrying less, and
later in life][1], in both the developed and developing world. [One in nine][2]
Jamaican unions now end in divorce, [twice as many as forty years ago][3]. The
real failure rate is higher, since many couples separate without the [legal
rigmarole][4]. Of the dwindling remainder, at least [half of spouses cheat][5],
and one in three [confess to being unhappy][6]. Finally, [studies attest][7]
that most people feel worse about their marriages over time.

Not exactly a gold-ringing endorsement of wedlock. On the contrary, all that
misery suggests we should [call the whole thing off][8]. Maybe matrimony has
served its purpose, guiding us through some purgatorial middle stage of social
evolution, from the savannah to the verandah. To wit, the long-term decline in
marriage is often linked to the rise in female education. As women get higher
degrees and financial independence, [the thinking goes][9], they have less need
for men — and marriage. In country after country, from Argentina to
[Zambia][10], the data show more schooling leads to less schmoozing.

Except Jamaica. Running counter to almost everywhere else, here you’re way [more
likely to find a mister if you have a master’s][11]. But our divorce rates
follow the global trend. What gives? Why do marriages really fail?

Before we answer that, let’s decide whether matrimony is worth saving in the
first place. Cohabitation is [increasingly common][12] worldwide, allowing
partners to learn about each other, reap the benefits of proximity, share the
burden of childrearing, and split with expediency, all without the aisle. More
Jamaicans are also [choosing to live alone][13]. Aside from pleasing your
earthly mother and heavenly father, good reasons to tie the knot aren’t obvious.

Cue scientists rappelling through stained-glass windows. Thanks to long-running
experiments, we now know that wedlock [increases your life expectancy][14] and
decreases your risk of all kinds of diseases, [from the common cold to
cancer][15] (compared to singles and cohabitors). In addition, you’re more
likely to [finish grad school][16], [earn a higher salary][17] and [have
successful children][18]. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but those benefits only
accrue to satisfied couples. So what’s preventing most married people from being
happy?

[Monogamy][19]. Huh? Isn’t that the whole point of pairing off? Well, yes and
no. Underneath our sophisticated seductions, we’re just primates in pants. And
while we use our big brains to make individual choices, collectively our animal
instincts win out. [When it comes to monkey business][20], humans fall somewhere
between gorillas, where one alpha male has all the sex, and chimpanzees, where
everyone humps everyone else. As columnist [Dan Savage punned][21], people
aren’t monogamous, they’re monogamish.

[Our slightly polygamous nature][22] — very roughly two partners for every mate —
has always been fighting a losing battle against our strictly monogamous
nurture. In truth, every human society establishes some kind of unofficial
outlet for sexual promiscuity — eg, slavery or prostitution. The only difference
in the 21st century is the number of (mostly) women who can escape relationships
of infidelity, not the number of (mostly) men who indulge in it. What’s more, it
stands to reason that if we could invent a type of marriage that not only
tolerated but embraced the reality of male and female desire, spouses would be
largely content.

That’s exactly what happens. Partners who jointly engage in extramarital sex —
a.k.a. swingers — report notably [higher levels of emotional and physical
satisfaction][23] than their straight-laced counterparts. An incredible nine out
of ten describe their marriages as happy. Unlike adulterers, they are vigilant
about safe sex. And outside their libertine bedrooms, swingers — pegged at 15%
of unions — are [‘demographically indistinguishable from the general
population’][24]. (If anything, they are [less racist and sexist][25] than the
average John and Joanne — not least because they want to sleep with them.)

By right, matrimony and monogamy should be close cousins, not the identical
twins we’ve made them out to be. Our jealousies, fears, dreams and expectations
of relationships are not innate but insidiously inscribed by Hollywood, Hallmark
and the hymnal. That might sound like hyperbole, but its truth is found in the
widespread practice of [open polygyny][26] by [many remaining indigenous
cultures][27]. In short, it’s who we are. The recipe for a normal marriage is
simple enough — two lovers coming together in mutual trust and respect — but if
you want the spice of life, try doubling up the ingredients.
