When I signed up on February 22, 2005, TheFacebook.com had one purpose (and one
million users). There was no Like button, no App Center, no News Feed. It was
just a directory, [a digital phonebook of young college faces][1] and contact
information. Instead of coding your own gaudy website on [GeoCities][2], Mark
Zuckerberg’s fledgling company gave you a handsome profile in royal blue, with
links to your schoolmates. That was it—you couldn’t even add photos. It was
simple, straightforward and useful.

Fast forward. On its tenth anniversary, Facebook is [the most populous service
in human history][3] (1.3 billion users, or 1/6th of the planet). It allows you
to share everything, [absorbing a staggering 15 million pictures][4], 200
million links and 400 million messages in 70 languages every single hour. And
it’s everywhere—installed on all your devices, embedded in all your favourite
sites. By any measure, an unstoppable global hegemon.

Except for one thing. I’ve stopped using it, and if you have life goals, so have
you. The ubiquitous social network has devolved into a sewage stream of
shameless clickbait (You Won’t Believe What This Supermodel Did!), derivative
videos ([LeBroning][5] et al), and banal comments on banal events—in other
words, a complete waste of time.

Anything of interest is quickly buried in an avalanche of notifications and
invitations. (Joseph likes Mary’s photo! Judas gave a life in Candy Crush Saga!
Peter and Paul are now friends!) Far from strengthening our social networks,
Facebook has reverted us into obsessive, narcissistic tweenagers, [endlessly
preening][6] and passing notes in some vapid virtual classroom.

I’m not alone. Despite its unprecedented scale, Facebook is [hemorrhaging
millennials by the millions][7], the very demographic it initially bewitched.
This is what economists call a leading indicator. Like birds responding to
barometric pressure before a hurricane, this defection of youngsters suggests a
coming crisis for the Big Blue app.

Mr Zuckerberg sees the danger. In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram, [the
photo-sharing service][8] with 100 million users. In February, it acquired the
chat service WhatsApp for an eye-watering US$19 billion (roughly Jamaica’s GDP),
even though it has its own Messenger app. In addition to spending its way into
continued relevance, the company’s recent efforts [deliberately hide their
parentage][9]—like the smartphone app Paper, which integrates your News Feed
into a magazine layout. The subtext seems to be a tacit admission that its core
product—the Facebook social network—is broken.

To fix it, let’s take a peek under the hood. Facebook [assigns a score to every
post][10] depending on its kind (photo, status update, and so on). It also bumps
the score, like a biased professor, if the post is from someone you share with
often. Then it populates your feed with the high-scoring posts. But even with
bright engineers [constantly tweaking the formula][11], a visit to Facebook is
still an exercise in skimming and scrolling, as you separate the wheat from the
chaff yourself. And there’s a lot of chaff.

On the community news service Reddit, by contrast, users directly vote other
users’ posts up and down (somewhat akin to clicking Like buttons). The content
most valued in individual networks, or subreddits, bubbles to the top; the least
valued sinks to the bottom. If a post is boosted enough, it bumps onto a global
list, which Reddit calls 'the front page of the Internet'. Each user sees that
page and whichever subreddits interest her. In other words, Reddit shows you its
best stuff right away, every time you visit, and scrolling yields diminishing
returns. Zero chaff.

To regain its mojo, Facebook needs to overcome its moral queasiness and borrow
Reddit's meritocracy. Introduce a Dislike button, and treat our upvotes and
downvotes not as independent actions, but as collective referenda on each
other’s posts and photos. Of course, your feed will still reflect your interests
and relationships, but judgment on individual posts will be swift, ruthless and
efficient. Instantly, Facebook would stop being that thing you do when you
should be doing something else, and start being genuinely useful again. But if
you’re undecided whether this is a good idea, [share it on Reddit][12]. One way
or another, in a few hours you’ll have your answer.
