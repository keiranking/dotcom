In a perfect world, it would have been his swan song. Two home games against
archrival Australia, echoing the India tour only eighteen months earlier, in
which he and [the sporting world said goodbye to Sachin Tendulkar][1]. On recent
evenings, he might have recalled the electric joy and sadness that filled
Wankhede Stadium, and allowed himself a similar daydream — the cameras, the
press, the handshakes, the interviews, the guard of honour led by Michael
Clarke, and above all the cheering, jeering, gyrating crowd in Sabina Park, all
gathered to witness his final walk from pavilion to pitch.

It was not to be. The West Indies selectors did not pick Shivnarine Chanderpaul
against the men from Oz, creating a rather harsher exit for the 40-year-old
veteran — dropped from his team, with all the ignominy and inadequacy of an
aging spouse left holding the alimony cheque. When the glint of the axe
appeared, Chanderpaul texted his old teammate and new coach Phil Simmons,
requesting clemency. There was none. “Unfortunately,” [Simmons replied][2],
“length of service is not a criterion for selection.”

Were Chanderpaul regarded with the reverence accorded George Headley, Garry
Sobers, [Vivian Richards][3] or compatriot [Brian Lara][4], such a blunt coda
would be inconceivable. But where those batsmen displayed panache and grace at
the stumps, the elfin Guyanese has only ever had a kind of awkward
utilitarianism to offer, full of quirks and oddities. We enjoy when great
players make success look easy; Chanderpaul, from start to finish, revealed
cricket to be hard work. And his Indian heritage made entry to Windies sainthood
difficult, since it is unfairly reserved for the more Afrocentric (witness our
undying pride in the heroes that ‘blackwashed’ England in the 1980s).

Moreover, his dismissal seemed to fit one of the ur-stories of sport — the elite
athlete, singularly focused, deaf to criticism and blind to his declining
powers, who must finally be ushered off for his own sake as much as ours (see
Muhammed Ali, Michael Jordan, Lance Armstrong et al). But Chanderpaul deserves
better, if not from the WICB then from us, the unwashed masses. He is likely
gone from the international stage, but we can at least remember him well, and
for what he was — the last of the great West Indian juju-men.

Of the 3,000 souls to ever play Test cricket, only 35 have retired with [a
batting average over fifty][5], [only 24 have survived two decades][6], and only
eight have done both, among them Headley, Sobers and Chanderpaul. Even that
illustrious company belies his unique contribution, because no one in those
shortlists — which, lest you forget, contains the greatest batsmen of all time —
remained unbeaten at the wicket more often (18%), a fitting crown for the man
who Shane Warne complained “you need[ed] to crowbar away from the crease.” The
Guyanese ‘Tiger’ earned his stripes in 164 Tests, [more than anyone else in a
maroon cap][7], as many as Chris Gayle’s and Marlon Samuels’s entire careers
combined. He was, in brief, the most reliable batsman in history.

[What the numbers cannot divulge][8] is that Chanderpaul was also the last West
Indian with that special mystique, the last one who knew the pungent linseed-oil
smell of dominance firsthand, who felt an unbroken lineage of calypso custodians
behind every cover drive, who could conjure the spectre of defeat in his
opponents simply by padding up. His disappearance marks the dying breath of the
greatest dynasty in sport, from 1978 to 1995, [when the West Indies ruled the
world][9]. All that’s left now are a bunch of orphans, scrounging for scraps at
the foot of the ICC rankings table.

To be fair, the decline in Windies cricket is a misnomer, more accurately
described as stagnation amidst a rise elsewhere. Just as sabermetrics upended
baseball, creating new winners and losers, so cricket transformed itself in the
1990s from a game of talent to a game of training and technology, a change that
benefited richer nations at the expense of the poorer. Thus Australia, England,
and South Africa have batted the top spots between them since 1995, while
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies (alongside newcomers Zimbabwe and
Bangladesh) continue to struggle.

This more precise, more demanding, more lucrative sport has less room for
anomalies like the boy from Unity Village, whose crab-like stance, unorthodox
shuffle-step and overall eccentricity would now be excised in the name of
efficiency and an IPL contract. (Plus, you can’t take your guard with [LCD
light-up bails][10].) For better or worse, the game has moved on, rejuvenated
for a new century, with restless impatience for nostalgia. All the old generals
(Jayawardene, Kallis, Tendulkar) have fallen. The last man standing — as always,
as it should be — was [Shivnarine Chanderpaul][11].
