Here's what you need to know—dancehall artiste Vybz Kartel, born Adidja Palmer,
is on trial for murder.  Arrested at the height of his lucrative international
career, he has been legally incarcerated for thirty months awaiting the decision
now before the court.  While eleven souls determine his innocence or guilt, in
the court of public opinion a larger trial is simultaneously taking place.  The
defendant?  The justice system itself, charged again and again with
inefficiency, corruption, and prejudice.  Call it a labouring class action suit,
on the books forever, with two million plaintiffs.

For our disenfranchised majority, who may lack the income, literacy or leisure
time to read opinion columns, social commentary arrives via dancehall music,
which speaks just as eloquently, in our dominant language, and for free.  Super
Cat, Shabba Ranks, Bounty Killer, Ninjaman, Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Elephant
Man, Sizzla, Busy Signal, Mavado, Vybz Kartel—a long line of lyrical preachers
for whom, as often as not, prison is just a waystation on the road to
immortality and a house in the hills.  They speak—powerfully, poetically,
presciently—for and about the people they leave behind without leaving them
behind.

To arrest an artiste is thus to martyr them, to muzzle a voice validated by
millions. Hundreds storm the Supreme Court bastille each day, clamouring for the
release of their self-appointed 'World Boss'. On the cover of his book, ['The
Voice of the Jamaican Ghetto: Incarcerated but not Silenced'][1], Mr Palmer poses
as civil rights icon Malcolm X. And [his Twitter account][2] channels
anti-establishment sentiment to 76,000 followers: “This is a classic case of the
system vs ghetto, [the] poor [and] dancehall” and "The war [between us and]
Babylon is over 400 yrs old [and] we still a [fight]".

This gnawing sense of injustice is responsible for our current hydra, where
corruption and criminality snake from the alms house to Gordon House, and
threaten to choke our society.  A failed government, according to landmark
sociologist Max Weber, is one unable to maintain ‘a monopoly on the legitimate
use of physical violence’.  Let’s review the state of our state.

Swaths of Kingston are run by area dons through equal parts fear and
benevolence, leaving Members of Parliament a choice between collusion and
impotence.  Removing these garrison leaders instigates civil war, as in the
bloody extraction of Christopher ‘Dudus’ Coke in 2010, when uniformed officers
faced armed opposition from the people they are sworn to protect.

For their part, our police force continues to be more force than police,
[killing 255 men, women and children last year][3]. The comparable number for all
of Britain? [Zero][4]. British ex-cop Hamish Campbell, now Assistant Commissioner
of the Independent Commission of Investigations, says “there is a widespread
belief that the [Jamaican] police are killing people who can’t otherwise get to
the courts”.

Why? Because [our courts are impossibly backlogged][5], with over 400,000 cases in
the queue, some describing acts so barbaric, judges deny bail even though a
potentially innocent person will live for years in an inhumane constabulary
jail. To put that jaw-dropping ([and officially disputed][6]) number in
perspective, if we never added another lawsuit, and cleared ten a day, the last
holographic docket would wrap up somewhere in the year 2123.

Yes, our institutions fail, badly and regularly, so most of us have lost faith
over time.  But when everyone is watching, as we are now with Mr Palmer's trial,
it's a rare opportunity to restore that faith in a single deposit.  All of
us—rich and poor, defense and prosecution, Babylon and badman alike—are better
off when the system works.  When everyone does their job, from janitor to judge,
that simple but powerful display of competence has an outsized impact.  It
reinforces the social contract binding us in this experiment called Jamaica, and
reminds us that we are, imperfectly, out of many, one people striving toward
common goals.  It makes us a nation.

As Vybz Kartel offers, echoing Buju Banton and a long line of musical forebears:
“The life we live, it hard and poor/ that’s why them fight ghetto yute more and
more/ but ‘memba, we go on and on and on”.
