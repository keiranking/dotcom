The dying sun flooded the sky with orange watercolour, and the boy watched his
long shadow as he ran — it looked as if he were on stilts. The air smelled of
ash and the fritters frying behind the barracks. His belly gurgled, but still he
ran, past the low wooden buildings, past the three women preparing dinner, past
the outhouse, heading for the sound of laughter. He barreled into the clearing
and stopped, a small cloud of dust like tiny fireworks around his feet.

There they were — twenty or so men and women sitting haphazardly around Mr Hunt
as he read from a few dog-eared pages of newsprint. His voice was articulate and
sonorous, and the evening breeze slapped the broad wet leaves of the banana
trees in mock applause. As the boy approached, the old man paused and looked at
him. “And now,” said Mr Hunt, “let’s have a poem from young Oliver.”

Thus began the entertainment career of Oliver Adolphus Samuels, a métier
spanning five decades and an estimated 3,300 performances, stretching from the
plantation dirt of Tremolesworth, St Mary to the pinewood stage of Ward Theatre
in Kingston and far beyond, along the way transforming a country hand into a
national hero. He is welcomed into Jamaican communities wherever they form — in
New York, Miami, Atlanta, Toronto, London — not as a stranger or even a friend,
but as one of the essential comforts of home, alongside bulla cake, spiced bun
and Bombay mangoes.

Unlike Bob Marley and Usain Bolt, who have been lost to the [homogenizing
firehose][1] of [global fame][2], or luminaries like [Mary Seacole][3] and
[Malcolm Gladwell][4] whose island heritage is mere footnote, Mr Samuels seems
destined for a place alongside Louise Bennett and Merlene Ottey in the gallery
of in-betweeners — household names that mean nothing to foreigners and so feel
like open secrets to be held especially close at heart. But what is the nature
of that secret? What is the meaning of his resilient celebrity?

Mr Samuels’s stage persona is that of a pugilist teddy bear — full-bellied,
full-throated, full-throttle. He is unabashedly working-class, dismissive of
rules and etiquette, a blunt instrument of deadpan malapropisms and
equal-opportunity insults. Part dad, part dud, neither savant nor servant,
convinced of his dignity and comically apt to lose it, ‘Oliver’ is the
quintessence of how we see ourselves, or like to see ourselves, or at the very
least hope to see ourselves as Jamaicans — simple, plainspoken and authentic in
a world of complexity, confusion and contradictions. He’s our true north.

It’s a powerful archetype, which explains why his spirit inhabits so many of our
male media stars — we keep reincarnating him in vessels like Volier Johnson,
Winston Bell, Oral Tracey, and Alton Hardware (aka Fancy Kat). More than any of
them, though, it is Mr Samuels whose journey has tracked most closely with his
homeland. In a country with [a million people in destitution][5], it is fitting
that a boy who clambered out of rural poverty (with pit latrines where the
humorist recalls “cockroaches playing trumpet on [his] balls”) became the man
who found the knockout paunch.

But the stability of Mr Samuels’s fame also speaks to our arrested cultural
development. In the same diaspora cities he frequents, art is constantly in flux
as new faces, technologies and movements displace old. Not so in Jamaica. We
remain firmly shackled by the psychology of the plantation, where reputation is
built on longevity over creativity, and change resisted rather than embraced.

Though Mr Samuels’s success is undoubtedly due to his superlative comic timing
and hard work, a hidden part has been played by an industry and society heavily
biased towards what it already knows. This is why our theatre has decayed into
irrelevance, and our country has declined into complacency.

Progress only deserves the label if it outpaces life itself; otherwise it is
nothing more than the passage of time. In watching the comedian from the riotous
heyday of ‘Oliver at Large’, through his baroque collaborations with playwright
Patrick Brown, to his current late-stage work, for better or worse we have been
watching our nation age without advancing. When we laugh with him, it is
self-deprecating humour, but perhaps it should be tinged with the sadness of
knowing that somewhere in St Mary, another young boy is running down a dirt
path, [with nowhere at all to go][6].
