The painted motorboat cuts its engine, and we drift up the mouth of the narrow
river. The seawater darkens, settles and becomes a jade sheet of glass. On both
sides, spindly mangrove fingers weave themselves into a thick barricade, as if
to remind us we’re only visitors. A white egret glides into view, dips low over
the water and finds its nest, hidden in the silty forest. Way above our heads,
three black crows sail on the warm thermals, keeping watch. Gentle ripples
betray an unseen crocodile, annoyed at being disturbed. And a tree crab sidles
along a fallen branch. This is the Portland Bight, home to the Goat Islands.

Twenty-five kilometres east as the crows fly, another ecosystem is full of life,
this one featuring cranes without beaks and whales of iron. The Kingston seaport
is the busiest in the Caribbean, close to the Panama trade routes and blessed
with a large natural harbour, the perfect habitat for container ships.
Conditions are so favourable that the port has enjoyed near-constant expansion
for decades, a boon in our stagnant economy.

These two neighbouring environments — one organic, one synthetic — are connected
by a thread running halfway around the world. China Harbour Engineering Company
(CHEC) is building a regional operations port, and our government wants the
investment. ([The courtship isn’t new][1] — CHEC is building Highway 2000,
despite [a record of unethical behaviour][2] and [the objections of the former
Contractor-General][3].) And last year, they found the perfect spot for their
new venture — [Goat Islands][4].

You can predict what’s happened since. Politicians and businessmen, led by
Minister Omar Davies, have argued [the economic case][5] — US$1.5 billion
injection, 10,000 jobs, 21st-century competitiveness, etc. Environmentalists,
led by author Diana McCaulay, have argued [the ecological case][6] — endemic
species, hurricane buffers, irreparable damage, and so on. And the rest of us,
uninformed and apathetic by default, have written off the battle as a lost
cause.

Here are the facts. The Portland Bight wetlands, lakes and forests are a
Protected Area (PBPA) under the Natural Resources Conservation Authority Act. In
addition, the Fishing Industries Act created three Special Fisheries
Conservation Areas in its waters. It is a [Ramsar site][7] by treaty — ‘a
wetland of international importance’. [Birdlife International][8] considers it
an Important Bird Area (IBA). And the isles themselves are game reserves thanks
to the Wildlife Protection Act. With its shores, shallows, reptiles, fish and
fowl all wrapped in overlapping layers of legislation and protection, the Goat
Islands are as off-limits for development as it can possibly be (given nearby
human cohabitation).

But money doesn’t grow on endangered West Indian mahogany trees. The shipping
industry is immense, profitable and predictable, [keeping pace with the world
economy][9]. And a major bonanza is beginning. Cruise ships, container ships,
and oil tankers are only as wide as the locks on the Panama Canal. That single
measurement, known as [Panamax][10], has been a giant restraining rubber band
for a century, but it’s about to pop. Panama will open [a brand new set of
locks][11] in 2015, and the rest of the world is scrambling to capitalize.

Ports everywhere will need bigger cranes, to reach across the wider decks of
post-Panamax ships. Harbours, including ours, will need to be expanded and
deepened, since larger ships sit lower. It’s a gold rush for seaports like
Kingston Container Terminal, and firms like China Harbour Engineering. Crane
assembly? CHEC. Harbour construction? CHEC. Seafloor dredging? CHEC — they’re
[the second largest dredger in the world][12].

China, [who owns CHEC][13], is willing to drop US$1.5 billion into our coffers
because it stands to make way more obscene fees in the coming years. But we can
have our lake and compete, too. There are other sites for the port complex (the
original proposal was Fort Augusta). In determining the fate of Goat Islands, we
need to balance the benefits of moving quickly against the costs of
industrialization (see, literally, [Beijing’s unbreathable air][14]) and of
paradise lost.

Precisely due to unrelenting pressure to develop, virgin sanctuaries will only
become rarer and more valuable in the future. Ecotourism is [growing by 25%
annually][15], far outpacing the rest of the tourism industry, fueled by the
increasing scarcity and innate appeal of nature. If the government is genuinely
interested in Jamaica’s long-term prosperity, the smart money may be on [leaving
the crocodiles][16] to swim in peace.
