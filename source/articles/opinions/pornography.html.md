On October 30, 2006, Britons who turned to Channel 5 got an unexpected eyeful. A
man and woman were having sex on the telly. Not movie sex. Not simulated sex.
Real, unadulterated, bed-pounding, Negril-vacation sex. No modesty was spared.
Tiny cameras and lights were strapped to the man’s erect penis, and inserted
into the woman’s aroused vagina. After a few minutes of this *coitus abruptus*,
viewers watched from the claustrophobic confines of her cervix as his semen
spurted and dribbled.

What was this frontal assault on the senses? ‘[A Girl’s Guide to 21st Century
Sex][1]’, an 8-part series presented by the aptly named [Dr Catherine Hood][2],
an Oxford lecturer and sexual health expert. In a move that would make Jamaican
religious conservatives faint *en masse*, it was broadcast over-the-air (on the
British equivalent of our CVM-TV), free and nationwide, during the hallowed
Christmas season. When a few viewers predictably complained that it was
“inappropriate [for] vulnerable young girls”, [the English regulators kiboshed
the objection][3], because the content ‘sought to inform and educate rather than
stimulate or arouse’.

In fact, that was the whole point—to provide, at no charge, a frank and
comprehensive sexual education for everyone. Episodes covered sexual positions,
STDs, homosexuality, swinging, sex amongst disabled and overweight
people—essentially, the full range of modern erotic experiences as they really
happen. Britain’s openness, exemplified by its broadcasters, has paid off—their
teen pregnancy rates [have fallen to a 50-year national low][4]. Jamaica? [Three
times higher][5], and climbing.

Sadly, ‘A Girl’s Guide’ is off the air (unless CVM is interested). But all is
not lost. There is another fount of carnal knowledge freely available to
Jamaicans—internet porn.

Wait, don’t write the editor just yet. I’m not advocating for mainstream
pornography, the [US$8 billion industry][6] pumping out [50,000 movies a
year][7]. Quite the opposite. There are few things unhealthier for our cinnamon
population than watching dehumanized blonde women with artificial proportions
get paid to fake orgasms. Those staged bonkfests are more eradication than
education, undoing all the progress we’ve made in congress.

Another caveat: allowing children unfettered access to the Internet is always a
bad idea. Just as you restrict their movement in the real world, parents should
monitor their kids on the web, and for the same reasons. (And if you think your
angels won’t find the online red-light district, think again—[70% of children
now stumble onto hardcore content as young as age 11][8].)

But adults and maybe even adolescents should deliberately find the elephant in
the bedroom—crowdsourced sex video sites modelled after YouTube. (Like YouTube,
thousands of people [upload their home movies][9], but with fewer pets and more
privates.) These ‘tube’ sites, [which actively resist piracy and
exploitation][10], [have shot up in popularity][11], handling [more data than
Hulu][12] and [more traffic than Netflix][13]. With good reason. Visit one, and
you open a browser window into the vast, beautiful, irreducibly complex
landscape of humanity. In other words, you see regular people having regular
sex.

This is huge. Having sexual urges, and questions about how to satisfy them, is
part of being human. But asking those questions in Jamaica is often fraught with
peril. Peers mock, parents blush, pastors condemn. Inexperienced adults are left
stranded, afraid to reveal their naivete. Married adults are expected to perform
lovingly and dutifully, despite a culture that raised them to be alternately
chaste and violently sexual. Older couples are supposed to live in the space
between barrenness and boredom. And to add insult to impotence, masturbation is
usually verboten. Our religion and morality leave precious room for the birds
and the bees to fly free, no matter your age and stage of life.

Public videos of amateurs satisfy that natural curiosity while reinforcing a
positive body image and a tolerance for diversity. By definition, no money
changes hands. The camera is generally a tasteful distance away. And the
participants, as you would expect, are more focused on what they’re doing than
what they look like doing it. Tall and short, thin and fat, young and old, black
and white and every permutation in between—this is the human race at the
starting line.

The result, even more than ‘A Girl’s Guide’, is not something pornographic but
rather psychographic, capturing how and where and sometimes why people make
love. And if the Brits are any example, watching all that ordinary copulation
can be an extraordinary contraceptive.
