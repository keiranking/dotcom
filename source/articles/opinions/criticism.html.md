It’s a choice that affects who we marry, what we do, where we live, and how we
dream, yet few of us ever think about it—do you accept the world as handed to
you, or seek to change it?

What's around us seems pretty permanent—streets and stores, doctors and dancers
and decorators, buses and books and biscuits and bank accounts, misery and mirth
and mystery and mischief and murder. It's a big, messy, complicated universe,
and the easiest thing, the obvious, practical, pragmatic thing, is to fit in. Go
to school. Make friends. Listen to your parents. Fall in love. Get a job. Make
more friends. Fall out of love. Buy a car. Fall in love again. Move. Rent a
place. Get married. Get promoted. Have a kid. Buy another car. Have another kid.
Mortgage a house. And so on.

Trouble is, after about eighty years of this pablum, you die having affected few
and changed nothing. Proof? Every funeral. Your legacy is hot, stifling
boredom—a grandchild waxing about your smelly chair to apathetic half-strangers.
That knowledge, the long foreshadow of future heart failure, should galvanize
you.

There is another way. Cheat death through your ideas. Almost everyone in the
history books, from [Ayn Rand][1] to [Zeno][2], got there with their mind. And
by their example, accepting the world is a useless strategy. Progress is born of
dissatisfaction. If you want to be somebody, start with a long, hard, discerning
look at the world, or at least your tiny corner of it.

[Steve Jobs ][3]hated his phones, which led him to the touchscreen and app
ecosystem that has transformed our daily lives. [Jimi Hendrix][4] was
chronically restless, trapped by genre and form, which made him extend his
instrument to the amplifier. Dead at 27, he continues to influence musicians
today. [Constantin Stanislavski][5] filled notebooks tearing down his own
theatrics, out of which sprang the '[method acting][6]' that fills movies a
century later. He wrote: "the task of our generation [is] to liberate art from
outmoded tradition, and to give greater freedom to imagination."

Indeed, this is the goal of every artist, scientist, writer, philosopher, anyone
who wants to move us forward and make her mark. Liberation. Exploration. Freedom
of the imagination. In [his new TV show ‘Cosmos’][7], American astrophysicist
[Neil deGrasse Tyson][8] gives us the straightest path there: “Test ideas by
experiment and observation. Build on those ideas that pass the test; reject the
ones that fail. Follow the evidence wherever it leads, and question everything.”

Over the last six weeks this column has explored [Tessanne-mania][9],
[childbearing][10], [the Vybz Kartel trial][11], [the Oscars][12], [poverty][13]
and [the Bible][14]. Many have engaged these essays, but a minority of readers,
at varying levels of umbrage, have hurled a self-defeating response: “If you
don’t have anything good to say, don’t say anything at all!” It breaks my heart,
but they’ve got it exactly backwards. If anyone should stay silent, it is those
amongst us so feckless they offer only mindless praise. (Brand Jamaica! God is
God! Blarf snarf!) We have become a nation awash in sycophants, expert at
elevating mediocrity and eliminating dissent.

Criticism, paradoxical as it may seem, is a deep form of affection. Would you
rather nine friends who always say you look great, or one who tells you to ditch
the flats, swap the earrings and, wrinkling her nose, reminds you to brush your
teeth? Far from an outrage, unblinking honesty is to be cultivated; it is the
province of every unspoiled child. We stop speaking out because we learn how to
curry favour and influence instead, and call it growing up.

Every human being deserves dignity by default, but no idea does. It must be
earned, by laymen and laureates alike, through exposing itself to the light of
critique, and surviving. This column is intended as a breeding ground for larval
ideas, not just the ones I put forth, but the thousands more that spring up in
responses and conversations around the country. Nothing should be out of
bounds—not sex, not God, not whatever bundle of beliefs you've kept carefully
wrapped in darkness. Look out. It's a [brave new world][15], but it's ours to
change together.
