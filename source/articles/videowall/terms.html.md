# Terms & Conditions

These terms and conditions apply to the Videowall app (hereby referred to as "app") for macOS that was created by Keiran King (hereby referred to as "service provider", "us" or "we") as a freemium service.

Upon downloading or utilizing the app, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. We advise that you read and understand these terms prior to using the app. Unauthorized copying, modification of the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the app, translate the app into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the app remain the property of the service provider.

We are dedicated to ensuring that the app is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, we reserve the right to modify the app or charge for our services at any time and for any reason. We will clearly communicate any charges for the app or its services.

The app may store and process personal data that you have provided to us in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the app. We advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which could involve removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the app not functioning correctly or at all.

Some functions of the app may require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. We cannot be held responsible if the app does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.

If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the application, we assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.

Similarly, we cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, we cannot be held responsible.

We may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the application. We do not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless we inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.

## Changes to These Terms and Conditions

We may periodically update the Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2024-11-01.
