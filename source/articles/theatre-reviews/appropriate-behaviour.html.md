Unlike people, art is best loved conditionally. That's because the average
person is confusing but ultimately redeemable; the average play, not so much.
Brian Heap, who loves theatre, applies his own conditions—if the writer has
stood the test of time, and if the script has gathered acclaim, and if the
actors are experienced (and if they'll work for free), he'll make a go of it.

This has led to a number of entertaining, edifying productions—Trevor Rhone's
_Two Can Play_, before that A R Gurney's _Love Letters_, before that Yasmina
Reza's _Art_, and so on. All famous writers, all celebrated works, all with
established local actors (often the same ones). Mr Heap's latest endeavour,
_Appropriate Behaviour_, seems to fit his pattern. The scribe is Barbara
Gloudon, whose deteriorating National Pantomimes nevertheless make her our most
prominent living playwright. The stage is stuffed full of talent, old and new.
What's missing from Mr Heap's criteria? Oh, right. The acclaim.

There are two reasons _Appropriate Behaviour_ remains unburdened by
recognition—one financial, one functional. The script has eleven characters,
making it unproduceable in the Jamaican market. No one can afford to pay eleven
actors, so no one has staged the play for two decades. Now that Mr Heap has
tried, he has come up against Ms Gloudon's jellyfish script, with strands of
plot and character floating about everywhere.

_Appropriate Behaviour_ is set in a typical Jamaican office. If you work in an
office, you will recognize the narcoleptic environment, where management is
overstaffed, the ledgers matter less than the lunch menu, and no one does any
work (anyone who does is either promoted or ostracized). But Ms Gloudon
overpopulates her script—four grunts, two janitors, two consultants, a
secretary, a manager and whatever Miss Patience is—without turning them into
people or throwing them into a sustained conflict.

As a result, the characters talk a lot but the story goes nowhere. Two
co-workers get involved (against company policy), get spotted, but do not get
uncovered. Another two spend their time baiting a third about his sexuality,
with no lasting consequence. This might be chalked up to the playwright's
relative inexperience at the time, except Ms Gloudon's last pantomime, _Pirate
Jack_, was even more inchoate.

But the actors overcome the flawed writing. Mr Heap gifted himself an
embarrassment of riches (and a few embarrassments) in _Appropriate Behaviour_.
Here's a quick rundown. Nadean Rawlins, a Heap favourite, is so consistently
compelling she should steal Nadia Khan's Actor Boy statue as a public service.
Christopher McFarlane is the dramatic equivalent of a can of Red Bull—his
explosive energy lifts the entire show, if only temporarily. Marsha-Ann Hay,
Maurice Bryan, Marguerite Newland and Melward Morris are all competent.

Rishille Bellamy-Pelicie and Jean-Paul Menou are good actors that choose
inappropriate behaviours—she should walk more naturally and he should talk more
naturally. Althea Gordon-Clennon is the reverse—authentic, but not theatrical
enough. The cast lacks a unified tone; in truth, the whole show smells a bit
under-rehearsed.

Which brings us to the main reason _Appropriate Behaviour_ falls short—Brian
Heap's maddening unwillingness to extend himself. His productions should be
subtitled "Just Enough"—just enough set, just enough costumes, just enough
rehearsal, just enough resources to make it through. He seems more fussy about
which play he directs than which direction the play takes. The man is
knowledgeable, tasteful, trusted and talented. All he needs is Christopher
McFarlane's boundless energy.

Granted, he operates without grants on a shoestring budget. All the more reason,
then, to obsess over the particular shoestring. There's little excuse for a
character anachronistically referring to using shillings thirty years ago. All
of the missteps in _Appropriate Behaviour_ could have been reduced or eliminated
with additional time and care. Brian Heap, who loves theatre, knows that better
than anyone. The empty seats at the Philip Sherlock Centre must hurt him. So, as
the paying public, let's lay out our own conditional love—if the writer has
taken her time, and if the script has gathered followers, and if the actors are
excited, and if the director has tried his hardest, we'll make a go of it.

_Appropriate Behaviour_ runs until May 16.
