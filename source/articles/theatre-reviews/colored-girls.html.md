One half of arts criticism is, of course, to evaluate the work of art, to
appraise it and to place it in context, as the product of a specific person or
culture, a specific place or time, or all of the above. If the original work is
transplanted to another time, another place, or another culture, that job
becomes doubly difficult. Such is the case with _Colored Girls_, running this
week at the Edna Manley College of the Visual & Performing Arts—an adaptation by
Trevor Nairne, local playwright and director, of a seminal 30-year-old
choreopoem by American artist Ntozake Shange.

Paulette Williams grew up after World War II in racially segregated St Louis,
Missouri, the daughter of a wealthy black Air Force surgeon. She was bussed to a
white school, where she suffered. She married young, and suffered. She
separated, suffered, and attempted suicide. She changed her name to Ntozake
Shange, moved to New York, and staged a collection of her poetry called _For
Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf_. The play
went on to Broadway and pushed Shange into the American spotlight as a leading
black feminist voice.

So _Colored Girls_ is a work of intense pain, the pain of living a life doubly
disadvantaged—being black and female in America—without any crutches except
those you fashion for yourself. Seven actresses, draped in bright cloths,
deliver monologues describing domestic abuse, the loss of virginity (voluntary
and involuntary), unwanted pregnancy—the whole litany of psychological scars is
laid bare on the stage, as the women have their innocence and naiveté forcibly
removed by the men they encounter. The poems are filled with beautiful, layered,
deeply moving writing—the harsh cadences arrest the listener, punctuated by
softer ones that caress the ear.

Unfortunately, Trevor Nairne and the students under his direction fail to give
the writing its due. Shange’s poetry is packaged as confessionals taking place
in a balm yard, a spiritual space intended, according to director’s notes, to
“amplify the healing” of the women, but which has the opposite effect. Worse,
the confessions are under the guidance of three “revivalists”, led by a man!
This is a cardinal sin. Not only does it sully the sacred feminine space created
on stage, but it robs the women of their agency, effectively undermining the
raison d’être for the piece. The revivalists also lend a counter-productive
farcical tinge to a criminally serious piece of theatre, with outbursts and
reprimands played for humour.

When practicing monologues, actors often use a fellow actor as a dummy to
motivate their lines. The male revivalist, who remains on stage throughout, may
have been there in this capacity, to help the seven actresses-in-training. As it
is, their performances were uneven, with standout turns by Joan Sappleton and
Risanne Martin. Mostly, the students are hampered by the need to deliver a
performance—acting with a capital A, they play emotions rather than characters.
The School of Drama could use a big Stanislavskian kick in the assignments.

But the second half of arts criticism is being a curator for the public—guiding,
through cogent and articulate opinion, what should or should not be experienced.
_Colored Girls_ is still a must-see show, a brave and provocative work, staged
and acted by people committed to their craft. Despite missteps and mistakes, Mr
Nairne and his students should be proud to provide a glorious, life-affirming
breath of fresh air from the indistinguishable gaggle of ensemble comedies in
the marketplace.
