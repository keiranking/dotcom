News and opinion houses, in their desperate but necessary bid to grab readers,
listeners or viewers, are slaves to exaggeration and hyperbole. Reporting on a
gangwar shootout in Rockfort, the Saturday Gleaner screamed one word in
blood-red block capitals: “RAMPAGE!” Points worthy of exclamation are lost in
journalism riven with exclamation points. Nevertheless, superlatives have their
place. And if you see five Jamaican plays in your short, embattled life, one of
them has to be Trevor Rhone’s _Two Can Play_.

The script, which won Best Original Play on its 1982 debut, tells its story with
such thunderous honesty that neither the passage of time nor Brian Heap’s
mediocre restaging can diminish its impact. Conceptually, _Two Can Play_ exists
at a busy four-way intersection—the gridlocked point of contact between male and
female gender roles, and the national identities of Jamaica and America.

It is the story of Jim and Gloria, a firmly middle-class couple in a war-torn
section of 1970s Kingston. Their children are illegal immigrants in America, out
of contact for fear of being deported. Except for Jim’s deathly ill (and unseen)
father, they live alone in their modestly-appointed house. Troubles grow each
day; gunshots rain each night. And Jim wants out—he wants to leave Jamaica, and
he wants to leave now.

Their attempt to reach America fills the first act, and the aftermath the
second. Along that journey, the ingrained rhythms of their relationship—who
fixes dinner, where he goes on a Tuesday night, what she does in the
bathroom—slowly fall out of step, until their interactions become the verbal
equivalent of a horribly tone-deaf duet. Rhone captures, like a photographer, a
time-lapse portrait of the Jamaican marriage in collapse, its foundations eroded
by year upon year of slights and oversights, squashed into the two-hour confines
of modern drama.

Brian Heap, either due to a lack of resources, a lack of imagination, or some
combination thereof, neglects to use most of the rudiments of theatre to enhance
Rhone’s tour de force. The set, intended to depict Jim and Gloria’s living
quarters, is badly designed, scaled and arranged. All exits and entrances
happen, drearily, on the same upstage plane. The size of the rooms, given their
economic bracket, is improbably large. And for walls, Heap uses an _ad hoc_
collection of flats, seemingly grabbed from some long-forgotten storeroom,
lacking even a color scheme to smooth the illusion.

Lighting and sound design are similarly uninspired, conferring little sense of
day or night, much less the emotional states of the characters. To understand
what’s missing, imagine how unsatisfactory your car would be if it contained
only the parts necessary to move from departure to destination. The overall
impression, in _Two Can Play_, is that of walking in on rehearsal night. With a
scheduled run of only six performances, such rough edges are unacceptable.

But you hardly notice those flaws, and maybe forget them entirely, once Alwyn
Scott and Nadean Rawlins bring Jim and Gloria to life. Rawlins is obviously the
more intuitive and nuanced actor, but Scott manages to hold his own as the
archetypal husband. As Gloria, Rawlins finds the perpetually fatigued,
frustrated equilibrium of her long-suffering housewife and allows the material
to ratchet up her blood pressure, scene by scene, until the veins stand out in
her neck. She plays each moment with surety, unafraid to look ugly or foolish in
front of an audience.

Scott, however, remains obstructed by his awareness that he is acting, and so
cannot find the emotional range needed for Jim, a man whose artifices are
harshly stripped away throughout the play. His turn is competent, though unable
to occupy the shadow of the original actor in the part—the late, great Charles
Hyatt.

Trevor Rhone’s recent passing leaves Grace McGhie—the first Gloria—as the only
remaining parent of _Two Can Play_. Although recent headlines indicate that
Kingston is still a bullet-riddled city, and although the line outside the
American embassy grows ever longer, she can perhaps smile that at least two of
her spiritual children (Rawlins and Scott) want to stay—and play—at home.
