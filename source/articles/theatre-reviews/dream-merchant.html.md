As a general rule, there are only two plays running at any given time in
Kingston. One is an American or British import, such as *Love Letters* by A R
Gurney (American) or *Bedroom Farce* by Alan Ayckbourn (British), preloaded with
accolades (Pulitzer nominations, celebrity casting, extended runs), produced at
a prominent location (Philip Sherlock, Little Little Theatre) and attended by no
one (except the family of the cast and people who write criticism for major
newspapers).

The second is a homegrown comedy, which we can fictionally call *Get Dem Fi
Laugh*, written by an untrained playwright, featuring an ensemble cast of a half
dozen or so talented actors playing stock roles straight out of the *commedia
dell’arte*—the clown, the shopkeeper, the cavalier, the statesman—embroiled in a
plot involving adultery and/or jealousy, launched on a stage the size of a large
walk-in closet and frequented by the entire working-class population of Jamaica,
from the bureaucrat down to the bureau-maker.

At the moment, *Money Worries*, *Bashment Granny 2*, *Backbiter*, and to a
lesser extent, *RRR 2K9*, are all *Get Dem Fi Laugh*, trivially distinguished by
different names and name actors. As a test, find the page in today’s Gleaner
where they are advertised—look for verbal klaxons like ‘Comedy Extravaganza!’
and ‘Comedy Spectacle!’—and cover the names with your hand. Now try to tell
which group of smiling, bug-eyed faces is which.

This is our quandary (or, in patois, our *kraasiz*). To enjoy theatre that
respects its audience and medium, we must turn to (mostly foreign) plays that
have little to say about the Jamaican condition; to enjoy cultural relevance, we
must endure productions that often fail to observe fundamentals of plot and
character development.

Adrian Nelson has resolved that quandary.

His latest play, *Dream Merchant*, is a dream come true—a playscript with a
solid structure and believable, playable, theatrical characters, under the
guidance of experienced, trained hands and brought to life by extraordinary
actors—in other words, a ‘roots’ play rooted in theatre essentials. It’s an
honest-to-goodness comedy extravaganza!

*Dream Merchant* is the story of a poor country girl, Shauna (Kedicia Stewart),
who, while washing dirty linen for a living, dreams of music stardom. Her
boyfriend (Tesfa Edwards) is a struggling young farmer with no future. On the
advice of her neighbour, Miss Shirley, a former go-go dancer played by the
hilarious and healthily-proportioned Dorothy Cunningham, she enters a talent
contest promising a record contract in Kingston. There, she meets producer Mr
Biggs (Ronald Goshop) and his wife, Ms Ting (Audrey Reid).

The party of five is a joy to watch—all the actors, including relative newcomers
Stewart and Edwards, find a rhythm with each other, balancing their deliveries,
aware of each other’s energy and space. Director Carol Lawes has done well by Mr
Nelson, handling his material and her actors with care and confidence.

All five turn in sharp performances. Stewart is ruthless in the way that
beautiful women can be. Edwards, with the least to do, is appropriately
downtrodden. Dorothy Cunningham, as the reformed woman of faith, is a master of
physical moments—if for nothing else, you must see Ms Cunningham move her
derriere. Ronald Goshop, whom we met decades ago in sturdy classics such as
*Smile Orange*, gives his Mr Biggs a casual dominance that works well.

And then there is the phenomenon known as Audrey Reid. Even amongst esteemed
peers, she stands out. Even with a creative character, she elevates it. To watch
her onstage is to watch a leopard in the wild—a creature in her natural element,
supremely comfortable but never relaxed, always moving with purpose and
expediency, no wasted steps, no wasted breath.

There is an animalistic edge to her portrayal of the
embattled-but-never-battered wife, Ms Ting. Her lines with Mr Goshop slice like
a bird’s talon, leaving something acrid in the air between them. She conveys the
possibility of danger the way animals do—with heightened senses and pulses of
energy. Only Glen Campbell may match her comic timing in contemporary theatre.
She can throw a withering look like a knife, bring it back, and then throw it to
the audience for an additional laugh.

Here’s wishing Mr Nelson can be a merchant of many dreams to come. *Dream
Merchant* is currently running at Centerstage.
