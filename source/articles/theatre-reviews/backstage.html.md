A seasoned playwright throws his characters into onerous circumstances, forces
them to make difficult decisions, and then watches them fight to survive. This
is true for tragedy and comedy; the only difference is whether the conflict is
played for pathos or laughs. The tragedy of Sophocles' _Oedipus Rex_ (Will
Oedipus discover who killed his father and clear his own name?) and the comedy
of Patrick Brown's _Puppy Love_ (Will Dick escape his teenaged lover and clear
his own name?) share the same root—a character facing long odds.

The downfall of Karl Hart's fourth play is that the odds aren't long enough. In
_Backstage_, a fictional cast and crew take a show from script to stage. We see
a reading of the script, a number of rehearsals, some dressing-room undressing,
and segments of the inscribed show, _Just Soups_. But we never get a sense that
the show is truly endangered. It's not that Mr Hart doesn't provide obstacles,
but that the obstacles are too easily overcome. The characters worry, but we
never do. The whole thing trundles implacably towards opening night. Given the
many obstacles Mr Hart must have overcome to get _Backstage_ on the stage, this
is a minor tragedy in and of itself.

_Backstage_ combines two potent tropes. The first is the let's-put-on-a-show
plot device, which usually lends a natural momentum to the story, as time ticks
away. (Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney launched careers on these stories.) The
second, related trope is the use of a play-within-a-play, which allows for
self-reflexivity. (Hamlet recreates his father's murder in a play to enrage his
uncle, and Michael Frayn's hilarious 1982 play _Noises Off_ features three
failed performances of its farce-within-a-farce.)

_Backstage_ squanders the potential of both techniques. One of the better
scenes has the actors adjusting their performances according to the director's
shouted instructions. A funny idea, but Mr Hart only finds a handful of
punchlines, leaving dozens more to waste. And throughout, we are left to guess,
infer or remember how much time remains, when an overt indicator (a calendar?
repetition?) would hint at impending disaster.

The real actors, left without guidance by their real director Nicole Williams
(in her debut), do what actors do when left to themselves—anything they want.
Thus Brian Johnson reprises his over-enunciated anger from _Glass Routes_;
Gracia Thompson reprises her affectations from _Smile Orange_; Peter Heslop
reprises Peter Heslop from any of his last several roles; and Nyanda Cammock
watches them while looking good. This is mostly Ms Williams' fault, not theirs.
In fact, all four are so naturally likable on the stage the result is still
watchable. Thompson is dignified, Cammock and Johnson have chemistry and
Heslop's face is a comic study.

So instead of the "double serving of exceptional theatre" promised in the
programme, _Backstage_ feels half as fascinating as it could have been, with
missed opportunities in the script, direction and characterizations. But there
is yet a bit of drama to unfold. Having thrown his work into onerous
circumstances, and been forced to make difficult decisions (one performance was
already cancelled), Mr Hart now has to watch _Backstage_ fight to survive.
