Artists, by definition, take their private lives into public spaces. Public
spaces are terrifying because they tend to attract the public. Once the lights
go up, that public—unerring, unforgiving, unknown—becomes a jury. Meanwhile, the
artist awaits the verdict, worrying she is too light- or dark-skinned, too
unrefined or educated, too green or dated—a thousand ways of not being good
enough.

Thus the artist thirsts for validation. Affection. Applause. Awards. Anything so
she can believe in herself. But there's a thin line between believing _in_
yourself and believing yourself. Believing _in_ yourself is thinking you can be
great. Believing yourself is thinking you already are.

Sabrena McDonald is one of the most talented under-30 thespians working in
Jamaica, and one of the few capable of carrying a one-woman show. But she does
not carry _Slim Actress_, which had its only performance on Saturday night, and
the reason lies in that thin line.

First, form. A one-person show is almost impossible to pull off, because that
one person must hold our attention, broken only once for intermission, for two
hours. There is no one to prompt a forgotten line, no one to rescue a flat
moment, no one to elicit a raw emotion. Failure is a clear and present danger.
Amongst the myriad terrors of performance, it stands alone—it is the King Kong
of acting. Like the beast, it is best approached with great care, great
experience and a great idea (see Trevor Rhone's _Bellas Gate Boy_—he was 62 and
believed _in_ himself).

Amongst the myriad terrors of performance, the one-person show stands alone

Ms McDonald, brave as she is, lacks two out of three. Despite the help of some
experienced hands (Trevor Nairne lent direction, Michael Holgate lent movement),
_Slim Actress_ has no unifying theme. The material is a motley collection of
monologues, poetry and dance written by the artist over a period of years, some
of which gathered local awards, including one from the Prime Minister. Not too
shabby, but not too coherent, either. (Teneile Warren masked the arbitrariness
of the pieces in her showcase last year by sharing onstage duties with a
half-dozen friends.)

Second, tone. _Slim Actress_ is, as the program reminds us, "a celebration of 18
years as a theatre artist." Note to Ms McDonald: When you are only 30, do not
celebrate the past eighteen years. Work your ass off—humbly, preferably—and hope
like hell you'll be around eighteen years hence. Nobody cares what you did at
12, unless you can make us care.

But there is much to like about _Slim Actress_, and the slim actress behind it.
For one thing, she almost pulls it off. In '99 and a Half', an older woman
wrestles with a real problem—whether her life qualifies for the local version of
the afterlife. McDonald is at her most relaxed, which allows her to find a
comfortable rhythm—the words land on the ear like fallen leaves on grass. In
'Better Off a Boy', a businesswoman shrugs off the self-imposed shackles of her
father's gaze and workplace testosterone. McDonald is at her most honest, which
allows her to be effective—the real-life loss of her father writ large.

Ms McDonald has range, which is shorthand for saying she can play both a
fundamentalist and an atheist, both uptown and downtown. And she has energy,
which will mature into presence. She is a highly valuable commodity—female,
black, driven, talented—with all the right tools. In other words, she is
perfectly positioned to grow into greatness. But, unless she puts down the Prime
Minister's award and reinstates a preposition, she won't quite pull it off.
