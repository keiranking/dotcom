Living in a country with beggars at the traffic light, prostitutes on the
corner, and gunmen in the streets drives home certain truisms. We, as a people,
are dissatisfied. We, as a people, want more. We, as a people, are tired,
frustrated and disillusioned with our jobs, our schools, our spouses and
coworkers, our politicians and parties and government, our roads and buses and
taxis and tolls, our bills and fees and taxes and payments and loans. That’s how
you feel, right? Right.

This peculiar mix of apathy and anger builds inside you until you quit your job
or start smoking, get drunk or get high, beat your wife or leave your husband,
find God or try to kill yourself. Here’s a better idea. Go see *Diana* at
Centerstage. You’ll feel better, and you’ll get to watch characters who do most
of the above, anyway.

Patrick Brown populates his remounted playscript, *Diana*, with some
long-suffering (and thus highly frustrated) Jamaicans, starting with its title
character, a struggling nightclub dancer brought to life by Camille Davis (not
to be confused with Cameal Davis, ascendant star of *Dreamgirls*). Davis
provides a subject lesson in stage acting—the art of living truthfully under
imaginary circumstances. The simplest yet most powerful pleasure of watching
theatre is its immediacy, and Davis lets us witness her joys and heartbreak, her
pain and relief, minute by minute, beat by beat. Lovely stuff.

The Jambiz stable, along with one inductee, fills out the other roles—Glen
Campbell, with a paunch, as Diana’s employer, Pops; Courtney Wilson, with a
bigger paunch, as her beloved; Chris Hutchinson, with a six-pack, as her wicked
and wild suitor; and Sakina, with a washboard stomach, as her deaf-and-dumb best
friend and exotic dance partner.

Glen Campbell and Sakina are instantly convincing, as expected for such talents.
In recent years, Campbell has eased gracefully into more supporting roles
without sacrificing either dignity or vivacity (which puts him in the fine
company of actors like Edward G Robinson and Lewis Stone). His style has
similarly concentrated—he conveys more by doing less.

Sakina’s onstage energy, by contrast, is ceaseless but infectious (if at times
excessive). She has that elusive and intangible quality—presence—which insists,
like a lover, on your gaze.

Wilson, though not as seamless, warms up by the middle of the first act, and he
and Davis display the familiar body language of a couple. Hutchinson fails to
nuance his muscled thug, Babyface, spending his time swaggering around the
stage.

*Diana* reflects the comfort of a director who feels at home. Trevor Nairne’s
production is perfectly scaled to the confines of Centerstage—tucking a kitchen
entrance upstage left, packing the walls with tchotchkes, and sending his actors
to the downstage corners every so often. And there is one magical
how-the-heck-did-they-do-that moment the first time Diana’s battered, broken
house changes into Pops’ luminescent nightclub.

Such directorial competence is rare enough in local playhouses, but with
*Diana*, Nairne has done much more than block actors on a well-built set.
Through the judicious and precise use of the tools of theatre, *Diana* throws
us, without reserve or apology, into the aspirations of ordinary Jamaicans—the
kind of working-class citizens who don’t have the time, the diplomas or the
resources to read theatre reviews in the newspaper. Life is too short, and too
hard, and too unforgiving.

One scene opens with Wilson alone on the stage. His character is waiting up,
late at night, for Diana to return. Nairne kills the lights except for amber
rays peeking through the louvres. We must wait for Diana as well. All of us,
sitting in the dark, phones at the ready, waiting for a loved one to reach home
safely.

*Diana* captures, and by its existence preserves, and therefore elevates, such
elementary truths of living in Jamaica—the life of the construction worker, the
dancer, the barman and the badman. No well-turned phrase or cheap industry award
can repay Brown and Nairne (although they certainly help). The only appropriate
tribute is your laughter, and your tears, and your applause.

*Diana* runs Wednesdays to Sundays at 8pm, with additional matinees on the
weekend.
