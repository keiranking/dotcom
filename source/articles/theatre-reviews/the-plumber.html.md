Roots plays have a bad reputation. Theatre practitioners quietly shun them.
Theatre critics quietly illegitimize them. Theatre patrons quietly avoid them.
In polite society, they are decried—quietly—as simple, base entertainments for
the hoi polloi. Not exactly an open-minded attitude, but whatever, right? To
each his quiet own.

Enter Stages Productions, the powerhouse behind a line of smash-hit roots plays
stretching from Negril to Morant Bay, including _Bashment Granny_, _Money
Worries_, _The X-tortionistz_, _Serious Business_ (now playing the North coast),
_Passa Passa Daily_ (now playing the East coast) and _The Plumber_ (now playing
in Kingston). Their runaway success (three concurrent shows!), and their piles
of money have made polite society grow increasingly impolite.

Gentlemen, dig your trenches. The class war is on, and the opening skirmish may
well have been February 9, when Simon Crosskill interviewed Stede Flash
(co-director of _The Plumber_) on _Smile Jamaica_. Abandoning journalistic
ethics, Mr Crosskill asked Mr Flash whether he ever thought about doing
'serious' theatre, like Shakespeare, and capped a one-sided evisceration with
the bullet, "It'll be a cold day in hell before I see [a roots play]."

Maybe this explains the frigid rains ending our islandwide drought.

What Mr Crosskill evidently doesn't know (and will hurt him) is that old Willie
'The Bard' Shakespeare got a bunch of friends together, built a theatre in the
capital and wrote some raunchy comedies for the hoi polloi. _Titus Andronicus_.
_The Taming of the Shrew_. _Merchant of Venice_. When he got rich, he stopped.
It took three hundred years for him to be reinterpreted as high art.

So Paul O Beale (writer of _The Plumber_), who got a bunch of friends together,
built a theatre in the capital and writes raunchy comedies is in pretty good
company. All he has to do is wait three hundred years.

But don't celebrate yet. _The Plumber_ is not _The Comedy of Errors_, just a
comedy with errors. And watching it invoked an entirely different popular
theatre with a bad reputation—the American minstrel show. The parallels are
strong enough to worry your inner sociologist.

_The Plumber_ is, ostensibly, about a policeman suspecting and then uncovering
his wife in an affair. Never mind that. It's really about bringing some familiar
characters onto the stage, characters from prior Stages shows, presented so as
to blur the line between person and persona—Garfield 'Bad Boy Trevor' Reid,
Michael 'Stringbeans' Nicholson, Everaldo 'Stamma' Creary and Andrea 'Delcita'
Wright. These performers are not in the show; they are the show. The play is
best understood as a pretext for Stamma and Delcita to run through comedy
routines.

The minstrel show was the same—with stock characters like Mr Bones, Mr Tambo,
Jasper Jack and Zip Coon thrown into comic misadventures. Originally played by
whites in blackface, the art form became a lucrative income stream for black
performers willing to blacken up. (Stages Productions reportedly pays twice as
much as other local troupes.) The best performers earned celebrity with blacks,
amongst whom minstrel shows were wildly popular. They became inextricably
associated with their roles, just as no one knows who Keith Ramsey is, but
everyone knows Shebada (Stages' biggest star).

Not enough? Here's more. Both switch between playing off each other and directly
with the audience. Both entertain with sung comic verse. Both employ sets that
are little else than glorified backdrops. Both rely heavily on physical comedy
and one-liners. Both use male actors for some of the female roles. And here's
the punchline to the gut—in _The Plumber_, Andrea Wright, a beautiful
dark-skinned woman, blackens up to become Delcita.

Is this a moral death knell for _The Plumber_, for Stages Productions, or for
roots theatre? No. It is merely the teething pains of a recently reborn people.
Black minstrelsy thrived from the American civil war onwards, as whites found
new forms of oppression, and blacks new forms of expression. Our nation, in its
latest incarnation, is not even fifty years old. As plantocracy gives way to
democracy, with much kicking and screaming from polite society, the hoi polloi
are having a good laugh.

In time, the blackface will disappear, revealing the black faces underneath. The
best part? Simon Crosskill won't be around to see it.
