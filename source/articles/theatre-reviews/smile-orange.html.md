Is there anything left to say about _Smile Orange_?

Who amongst us, almost four decades after its initial run, does not know its
quintessentially Jamaican protagonist, the pragmatic and irrepressible trickster
Ringo Smith? He long ago escaped the typed page, long ago bounced off the Barn
Theatre stage into our collective consciousness, more real to us than Paul Bogle
or Marcus Garvey, men who lived and died but have since faded into the obscure
purgatory of history textbooks and primary school walls.

Who amongst us, almost three million souls surrounded by white sand and water,
is ignorant of its truths? _Smile Orange_ tells us about ourselves, as art
should—about living in America’s shadow; about using what you have to get what
you want; about wanting what you can’t have; about the white man and the black
man and everything in between; and finally, about how Jamaica is, and must be, a
place where these truths are self-evident.

And who amongst us is not indebted to its scribe, the incomparable Trevor Rhone?
The man cobbled together a rural childhood, a foreign education and an
intractable dissatisfaction with his circumstance into a string of stage plays
stretching from _The Gadget_ (1969) and _Smile Orange_ (1971) to _Old Story
Time_ (1979) and _Two Can Play_ (1982). Even that impressive list
underrepresents his contribution to the ongoing experiment called Jamaica—for
instance, co-writing _The Harder They Come_ (1972) with the late Perry Henzell.

_Smile Orange_ was Rhone’s first hit, and deservedly so, running for 245
performances. Although the new production is at The Little Little Theatre,
rather than the more historically resonant Barn, the magic lingers still. So
much time has passed that the stage, dressed and waiting for actors, is by
itself a kind of museum, a time capsule preserving the hopes, fears and laughs
of a people who were scarcely ten years into independence—Miss Brandon’s curved
desk, the pastel orange and sea green walls, the cursive hotel insignia, the
scuffed furniture in the waiters’ area.

And then the lights are up, Ringo bustles down the aisle, Joe changes his coat,
Miss Brandon fixes her make-up, and _Smile Orange_ pulls you into its peculiar
world, now simultaneously past and present. Ringo, once a young, lithe Carl
Bradshaw, much later an energetic Glen Campbell, is now the wiry, madcap Donald
Anderson, who slips comfortably into the iconic orange waistcoast and bowtie.
Everaldo Creary is pitch-perfect as the bumbling, blubbering Buss Boy,
Cyril—almost crippled with fear, his scenes with Anderson crackle and pop. Shaun
Drysdale and Gracia Thompson as Joe and Miss Brandon are convincing, if not
captivating; Hugh Douse, as the Assistant Manager Mr. O’Keefe, is less so.

Such a trifle cannot spoil the show, especially with Mr Rhone as director. But
with such talent, why this play, yet again? We still need cogent voices to
skewer our lives in song and dance, on stage and screen. The world is different
than it was forty years ago, when Mr Rhone and his friends turned a residence
into a theatre, and thus a house into a home. Why not a new play, from hands
informed by all that has gone before, by gadgets and games, schools and smiles,
oranges and old stories?

If you haven’t seen _Smile Orange_, go and see it. If you have seen it, go and
remind yourself. But in the warm afterglow of the production, when smiles come
easily, if you see Trevor Rhone, tell him he still has the last laugh, inside,
waiting to come out.
