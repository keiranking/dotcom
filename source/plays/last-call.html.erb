logline: In 1949, an ordinary man is driven to extraordinary despair in
  his effort to track down the only woman he's ever loved.
synopsis: It's 1949 in British Jamaica â€” exactly ten years since Cecil, Rose,
  Joseph and Daphne vowed to meet at the famous Myrtle Bank Hotel. Cecil and
  Rose are successful loners; Joseph is struggling and looking for Daphne, who
  has disappeared. Now, their last chance at happiness depends on keeping a
  forgotten promise with friends who have become strangers.
