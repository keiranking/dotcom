## From Toronto Pearson airport to Union Station

1. Go to Terminal 1.

1. Buy a Presto card. (Load it with ~C$30.)

    Green-and-gray vending machines should be near the public transit area of the ground transportation level.

1. Follow signs for the UP Express train. Before boarding the train, tap your Presto card on one of the waist-high card readers.

1. Take the UP Express train from the airport to its final stop, <span class="signage">Union Station</span>.

1. On exiting the train, tap your Presto card at one of the waist-high card readers.

## From Union Station

1. Follow signs for the TTC subway.

1. If you don't already have a loaded Presto card, buy a one-way ticket from one of the TTC fare vending machines.

1. Take the <span class="signage signage--subway">1</span> subway northbound towards Finch.

    Note: Union Station lies in a transit U-bend, so tracks in both directions are northbound.

1. Get off at <span class="signage">Eglinton</span>.

1. Exit the station at Yonge St and Eglinton Ave. Walk east (past the CIBC) along Eglinton for about 3 min, until you reach <span class="signage">Lillian St</span>.

    Use the right sidewalk on Eglinton, in the direction you are walking.

1. Turn right onto Lillian St. The corner building is 98 Lillian St.
